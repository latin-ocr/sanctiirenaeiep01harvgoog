short of perfection3 and the ¹imperfection of Light is Q

Shade3 arguing therefore from the physical to tbe me-
taphysical, it appears to have been concluded by him,
that so soon as the Deity developed any principle or
created essence beside himself, the necessary relative im-
perfectiori of this principle, ’involved in itself substantive
evil. Evil in fact, although of a positive character with
relation to the perfection of good, is relative with respect
to the imperfect good, to which it leads up by insensible
degrees; “vvhen I vvould do good evil is present with
me.'' is descriptive of all created good, however exalted;
but it is in a positive and absolute sense, that He, who
is the Perfection of All Good, ¹¹ chargeth His angele with
folly.”
