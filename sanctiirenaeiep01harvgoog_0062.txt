IONIAN PHILOSOPHY. xxxv

of matter was acknowledged in the pantheism of the suge, Phera-
and the polythcism of the multitude; and by a natural deve· yffi
lopment the earliest form of Greek philosophy was the physi· “
cal system of the Ionian school; in which each of the four
elementa was successively adopted as the fundamental ἀρχή
or principle from whence the entire system of the material
universe was evolved. Notions with respect to a divine
principle may have existed among races of an earlier
civilisation, but these for a time were overlaid in the
grosser material theorias that formed the first foundation
of Greek philosophy. Half a dozcn generations passed
away before this higher principle could struggle once more
into light; and the temple of Hellenic wisdom, most beau-
tiful in its symmetry as it came from the hands of Plato,
concealed heneath its ground-line a rough misshapen mass
of heterogeneous material.

So Pherecydes of Syrus imagined carth to bc the
ultimate principle from whence all originated, and to which
all returned¹. His follower or in any case contemporary
Thalea having studied in Egypt, where the rank growth
of the year was so evidently dependent upon the fertilis-
ing waters of the Nile, taught, as we have already seen,
that water was the first elementary principle, containing
within itself the seeds of all physical development. This
view was in no degree less gross than the preceding. It

was fully as atheistical, and Cicer0, as wc are reminded
