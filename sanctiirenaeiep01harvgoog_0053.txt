the Marcosian theory may be traced back to some such
origin as this.

Proeeeding from the primary to the secondary deve-
lopment of the heathen religions idea, it may be observcd
that Egypt no doubt gave its first impulse to the idolatry
ef classical Greeee‘. Its mythology, based upon the
physical phenomcna ef a southern sky, and a land teeming
with the richcst products, received a magnificent develop-
ment, when reproduced in the myths of the keen-vittcd
and poetical Greek. But the very brightness of the
intellectual creations of this wonderful pcople, in the
infant state of their political existence, dazzled them,
and preventcd them from tracing excellencies in the
deeper truths preserved, here a little and there a little,
among their barbarian prototypes. They vvere bad
observers of Egyptian antiquitieS, and missed much of
the latent meaning that was veiled beneath the substance
of the Egyptian mythology, while they scized upon the
aesthetical features that presented themselves externally,
and acclimated them among the hills and vales of Greece.
A few of the wisest and best of their racc, rising above
the ³mythical traditiens that scrvcd to engross the religions
sense of the multitude, reverted to the sources of thcir
intellectual and political history, and found in the ances-
tral fanes of Egypt some traces at least of the vvisdom
that they sought.
