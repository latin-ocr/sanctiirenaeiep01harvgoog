ciffi, at the time of the Babyloniau Captivity‚ when the first
-—- deportation of the ten tribes took place, bordes of immi-
grants from ¹Babylon replaced them, and took possession
os the most desirable portions of Samaria. The intro·
duction of their religion, and their intermarriages with
the temnant of Israel, caused the deadly feud that ever
since existed between the J ew of pure blood and the
hybrid Samariten. Simon Magus, a Samaritan, taught a
completely Zoroastrian doctrine. But in all probability it
was a doctrine that had subsisted in certain families of
Samaria almost from the days of Shalmaneser. So also the
earlier Gnostic heresiarchs settled at Alexandria as immi·
grants from Syria and the East; and the mixture of Ori-
ental notions to be detected in the systema of Basileides‚
Valentinus, Carpocrates, and others, was the effect of
early association3 scarcely of contact with the philoso-
phising and syncretic Jew of Alexandria.

One consideration must have greatly commended the
Oriental and other systems of theosophy to thinking
minds, as compared with the religious belief of the more
civilised nations of the world; which was, that whereas in
Grecce and Rome polytheism was upheld as the religion
of the body politic, a higher faith possessed the Eastern
mind, which recoiled with hearty abhorrenee from the
gross debasemeut of every Western form of religion.
Philosophy, in fact, gained a religious clement in its union
with Theosophy; and prejudicial as aresulting Gnosticism
was to the peace of the Church during the first two cen·
turies‚ it is impossible not to see that the evil was not
unmixed with good3 and this concretion of ideas possibly
afforded a temporary place of rest to the weary spirit of
humanity, in its transition from the abominatione of pa·
ganism to the pure saith of the Church of Christ. Given

on the one side the gross darkness of heathen idolatry,
