τούτου, but the wisdom of God; words that the Valentinian
would interpret of Achamoth. It will not be necessary to
advert to any of their more palpable perversione of Scrip
ture, for they add nothing to our knowledge of Valentinian
principles; they only illustrate them.

Altogetber, therefore, we have seen that the Valenti·
nian system, in many of its notions, resembles the scheme
set forth in the Timaeus of Plato; and since the philosopher
adopts ¹Pytbagorean views, more especially with reference
to the mundane soul and numerical harmonies, it is pro·
bable that this phase of Gnosticism gave back to the East
that which had been borrowed from it, several centuries
before, by the great master of physical philosophy. To
these two systems of ancient speculation, therefore, we
have chiefly reverted for the light that has served to gulde
us through this many system. The purely Oriental element
consiste in little else than the explanation of the creation
and harmonious action of the universe, by supposing a
series of successive emanatione, to be re·abs0rbed into the
Divine Nature; but always, whether in emanative diffusion,
or in ooncentrated sublimity, God was All Things, and
All Things were God. Bam, therefore, is perfectly right
when he correcto the notion put forth by Mosheim, and
so generally received, that we must look to the Oriental
systems of philosophy for an explanation of the Valentinian
theory3 for it symbolises rather with modes of thought
prevalent in Greece3 and, so far as Oriental notione are
involved, we trace them back to the Cabbala that the Jews
brought away from Babylon, rather than to Zoroaster or
