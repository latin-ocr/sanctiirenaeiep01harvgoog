mated by a soul of Divine harmony3 and without offering
to lead the reader through the arithmetieal meze, from
which Plato makes the mundane soul to be evolvcda
maze that Cicero, in speaking of an intellectual crac as
womero Platonis obscurius, takes to be the abstraet type ol
all thetis obscure, it may be sufficient ιο observe, first,
that a community of origin is clearly indicated between
this portion of the Platonic theory and the Pythagorean
derivation of all things from the mystical powers ol '‘num-
