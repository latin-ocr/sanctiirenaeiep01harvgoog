VALENTINUS. cxvii

io speaking of the Pythagorean arithmetical mysticism, aarum,

thus sums the decad, roi γὰρ ἓν, lio, τρία, τέσσαρα ’γίνεται Effyiiff

ίίιυ, ὁ τέλειος ἀριθμὸς, which was perfect, as foreclosingQ
the series of units, all succeeding n'umeration being carried ‘³³⁵⁷'
ou by combining the aelf-same unita with a decad. It
should be added, however, that Hippolytus also describes
the decad, in the Pythagoream theory, as symbolising ma-
terial substance ¹plas its nine accidents. This group then,
either as having a dynamis existence in the Tetrad‚ was in·

, tercalated between the Ogdoad and the Dodecad; or the

ι five Egyptian deities that were intercalated to bring the

twelve lunar months of thirty days into agreement with

ί the solor year, may have furnished the basis of the Decad,

· each term, as in the evolution of the Oydoad from the

,Ι Teu-ad, having been united in συζυγία with some other

Ι correlative term. The Dodecad, in the more ancient

s system, was in all probability zodiacah but in the Valen-
tinian scheme it expressed that imitative progression that
was of the very essenos of this theory. Thus, as in arith· offl-
metical notation, each successive Decod is increased by
units of addition, sothe Valentinian Decad having been
completed, was re·commeneod by an initial pair3 and in
the same way that Bythus and Sige preceded the Pleroma
of Intelligibles, the pair now added to the Decod to
form the Dodecad, headed the world of Sensibles; and
stood midway between the world of Intellect that they
foreclosed‚ and the world of Matter that was next evolved.
Valentinus, therefore, may have borrowcd the rough out
line of his system from theold mythology of Egypt, but
