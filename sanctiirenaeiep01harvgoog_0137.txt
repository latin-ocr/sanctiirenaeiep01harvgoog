Three ἄνθρωπος was borrowed from the Adam Cadmca of the
Ἢξζῐ Gabbala through the medium of ¹Philo's writings, mean·
ing the arrhenothele ideal of the human race; and by a
further prosecution of the same notion‚ Bythus himself,
in certain offsets of the Valentinian stock, was termed
'dvfpnrroa as having bccn the primary πονηρίαν, after which

man was formed κατ’ εἰκόνα. Thc Tetrad therefore with
the correlative feminine terms formed the ogdoad. But
V the Egyptian deities, as we have seen, were divided into
μων. three groups. The primary order, as Herodotus has
informed us, consisted of eight deities; and a certain
harmonical proportion subsisting between these groups,
justifies the inference that they were originally based upon
definite geometrical analogice, and that Valentinus adopted
from the Egyptian theosophy the same numerical mysti-
cism, that several ages previously had suggested to Pytha·
goras one principal feature of his philosophy. As there·
fore the second group of twelve deities emanated from
the primary Ogdoad in the old Egyptian mythology, so in
the Valentinian system the Deead first was evolved from
the ogdoad, and the Dodecad from the Decad. But the
analogy is only general, and must not be straincd. The
triple division of the entire system, and the co-existence
of an Ogdond and a Dodeead, as also the principle of emana-
tion of one series from a preceding clement, is all that is
adduced‚ but this is sufficient to connect the Valentinian
with the Egyptian method of progression. With regard
to the Decad, this too was evolved from the Tetrad, but
