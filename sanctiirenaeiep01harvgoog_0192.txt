Upon the doctrine of lrenaeus it rs not necessary to sunm nn
say many words. With few exceptione, and those not atn„ Ἓξ t
all dependent upon doctrinal discrepancies‚ the Artieles “”
of the Church of England might be illustrated singly
from the statement of Irenaeus. The Index will enable
each reader to do this for himself. The subject of the
Holy Eucharist alone has given rise to expressions that
need a few words of explanation.

First, l presumo that a comparison of the several
passages in the work c. Haereses, that have reference to
this subject, with the Fragment xxxvi, can throw uo
doubt whatever upon the genuineness of that Fragment;
they present the same Cathohc object of Faitb to us in
two different phasea. ln the work c. Hoer. the subject of
the Eucharist is advanced in opposition to the views
respectively, of (ι) the ¹Marcionite, who denied that the
creation and the good gifts of God stored up in it, are the
work of the Supreme Deity, or of the Divine Word3 and
(n) of the Valentinian, who affirmed that they were a
product of ignoranee and abortion. In either case there
was great disparagement of the Creator's works3 and the
author introduces the mention of the Eucharist in course
of his argument, not that he may explain the nature of

sthat Sacrament, but that he may illustrate his reasoning
from the known Catholic teaching of the Church, that the
Body and Blood of Christ are verily and indeed taken
and received by the faithful in the Lord's Supper. How,
therefore, should heresy declare that the Bread which
Christ himself consecrated as His Body, and the Cup
which He blessed as His Blood, are the creatures notos
the Word, nor of God the Father, but of some sub
ordinate Demiurge, half malignant and wholly ignorant?

No one, I think, will read the statements noted below
