sible to assent to the opinion advanced by 'Valesius that of Lyonn,
heuaeus, having been designated as the bearer of the an. 177·
epistle to Eleutherna, was preferred to the see that had
become vacant hy the death of Pothinus before the
letter was dispatchcd3 in this case, the name of his sub·

stitute must infallibly have replaced his own in the letter;
whereas Eusebius quotes as the commencemeut, ’χαίρειν

quainted with the Roman archives and Roman traditions,
confirma the statement. Irenoeus then was the bearer of
this Epistle to Rome, an. 177. The persecution of the
Church of Lyons, though sharp, was brief. Pothinus, 4ιιοιι
more than ninety years old, was subjeeted to such cruel
treatment as to die in prison; aud this took place, in all
probability, before Irenaeus had orossed theAlps; if therefore
it was necessary that his successor should be consecrated
by any foreign bishop, this visit of the bishop designate
to Rome was most opportund3 a messenger dispatched at
once would have arrived within a few days of Irenaeus,
making known the request of the suffering Church, that he
might be consecrated to the see of Lyons. This suppo·
sition clears away all historical difficulties3 for Eusebius
says expressly, both that Irenaeus went to Rome, as has
been stated, also that he was successor to Pothinus who
must have died while hc was out upon this mission. ⁶Ilo·
