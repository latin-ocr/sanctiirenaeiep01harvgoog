added without irreverence‚ like the Sons of God of the
patriarch Job, pealed forth the ⁴praisea of Bythus, who
reciprocated their joy.

But their praisc took also a practical turn. For as the
AEons were now ‘rci πάντα ἐν πᾶσιν, so each contributed
that which was most excellent in his individual being, sor
