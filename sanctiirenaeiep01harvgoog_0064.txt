now well established in philosophical language‚ applied it „⁸2³2
to νοῦς, as well as to the physical world He spolie indeed mm
of the sky and airas ἀμφότερα ἄπειρα ἐόντα, but there are
also expressions of his, in speaking of the infinity of Νοῦς,
that strongly remind us of the ἀπειρία of the Supreme

Pythagoras, Anaxagoras also journeyed into Egypt in
‘quest of knowledge, though nothing peculiarly Egyptian
is to be detected in his system of physics; but in all
probability he derived from this source a higher notiones
Dirine causation; so Anrsrorus describes his principle, ‘'cip-
