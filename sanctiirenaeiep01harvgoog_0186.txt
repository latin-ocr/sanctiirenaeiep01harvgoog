the ’second and fourth of Pfaff, may have been taken from
this work Eusebius again speaks of certain ³miscellaneous
dissertatione, in which the author makes mention of the
Epistle to the Hebrewa and of the Book of Wisdom. It
was in all probability a collection of sermons and exposi-
tions of various texts and passages of Scripture3 and under
this head we may rank the various Greek fragments that
indicate a commentary upon portions of the historieal
books of Scripture3 the Syriae fragment from an exposi-

Miinter3 aud the last, from the Vienna collection. It may
be added, that the Epistle to the Hemone, and the Book
of Wisdom are mentioned, not aa forming the main subject
