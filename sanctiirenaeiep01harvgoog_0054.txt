Egypt was the nursing mother of Polytheism‚ aud no
doubt Hraono'rus tells us truly, that the names of the
gods in Greek mythology, “hourly conceived and hourly uum„
born,'’ came across from Egypt3 σχέδον καὶ πάντα τᾶω.ιι.ι,

and identified with Isis3 but this name merely signified
the Divine Wisdom es manifested in creation. Poseidon,
or, as he was called in the Etruscan mythology, Neptune,
