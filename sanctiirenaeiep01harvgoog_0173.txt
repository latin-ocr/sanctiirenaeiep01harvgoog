Prpbpple apologises for his roughnesa of style, aa betraying the eon-

-³— seious imperfectiora of a writer, who is not handling his

own vemacular language, and hardly feels at home with

the idioma, that force of circumstances has compelled him

to adopt. If Greek had been his native tongue, there

would have been little danger that his style should be de-

based through barbarian contact; and since he was neither

of Gallio nor of Italian extraction, the probability is

, strengthened by this expression, that he was born in

Syria, and having been instructed as a child iu some

semma Syriae version of Scripture, was removed during the years
of hoyhood to Smyrna.

The date of our author's birth is also unknown. The

only elue we possess is the statement thatin his boyhood,

. παῖς ὢν ἔτι, he remembered Florinus as a fellow-hearer of

Polycarp. Florinus was, doubtless, his senior, for he

speaks of him as a person of some mark, and of courtly

anxious perhaps, than a mere youth would have been, to
ingratiate himself with the venerable bishop Polycarp.
But in his letter to Florinus he speaks of himself as is
usual with the elderly‚ aad says that he has a more vivid
recollection of events that passed before him as a hey,
than of those that had occurred more recently. At the time

therefore of writing this epistle to Florinus, Irenaeus was
not less perhaps than sixty years of age. The tone also
of the extract from his ¹letter to Victor, Bishop of Rome,
at the same period, marks rather the experienced Bishop,
addressing himself to a brother whose preferment to an
important see was of recent date. Irenaeus would scarcely
have thought it necessary to stimulate the vigilance of
Victor oster the prompt condemnation of Theodotus ao.

Charches an. 198. The caution then concerning Florinus
