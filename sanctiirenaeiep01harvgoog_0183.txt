Latin Fragments, all quote the work under the same title,
Qatnu the author himself indicates it in several passages
as the work proceeds. The ancient MSS. of the
Latin Version designate it either as, Redcryvtio et Eversio
salso cognominata Aquitionis, or as, Eaprobratio et Eversio
salaoe Aquitanis. The short title, Contra Haereses, is that

'Angustia certainly, copied this version.

The recovery of the Syrian fragments that are found
at the close of the work, gives colour to the supposition
advanced by the Benedictine ³editor, that a Syriae version
