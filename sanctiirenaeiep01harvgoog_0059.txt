So also Plato, in this respect et least departing from
the principles of his master Socrates (who discouraged
this practice of secking wisdom from without) visited
¹Egypt and studied under Seehuuphis at Heliopolis; alter-
u'ards hc went to Cyrene and Italy. It was also a part of
his plan, if Apuleius may be credited‚ to visit India, but
the troubled state of the Eust deterred him. Several
others of the Grecian suges may be trueed through the
the same courses of instruction. Thales of Miletus,
founder of the Ionio school of philosophy, was, on his
mother’s side, of ²Phoenician extraction3 he is said to

some considerable amount of his system from Assyria3
but it is more certain that he passed some time in Egypt,
and received instruction from the hierophants of 3Μωυ-
phis. Without entering into the consideration of any
other particular doctrine that he taught, we may merely
observo, that, living in the days of the prophet Jeremiah,
he taught very much the same doctrine with respect to
spiritual cssenccs, that was taught contemporaneously ut
Babylon, as we know from the fact that the Jews adopted
the same notion in their captivity; so harenosas tells us,

may truce in this the notion of the various angelic intelli·
genees of the Indo-Chaldaic Sephiroth on the one side,
and on the other, though in a fainter degree, the fore-
shadovving of the Platonie ἰδέαι. His notion thet water
