mentioned, and the author of the Qu. et Resp. od Ortho- ¹applied
dorna as also the later statement of Gregory' of Tours, and Ἢ.
certain Martyrologies· The fact that Tertullian, Eusebius,
Epiphanius, Ephrem Syrus, Augustin, Theodoret, Gyril of
Alexandria, as wellas these early Syriae fragments, and
the existing Latin Mss, excepting the Cod. Voss, all
withbold from Irenaeus the title of Martyr, will be con·
sidered by many to bea convincing proof that it does not
correotly belong to him3 aconclusion in which they cer·
tainly will not be shaken by the reasoning of the Benedic-
tine editor. The active part that Irenaeus took in the
Paschal question in the olosing years of the second cen·
tury, justifies the supposition that he may have lived
through the first five or six years of the third3 when he
would have attained, according to the supposition above,
to an age of between seventy and eighty years.

It bas already been shewn that the work of Irenaeus,
o. Hoereaes, must have been written between an. 182 and
1883 ie. between the fifty-fourth and sixtieth years of

life; and the vigour, judgment, and experience that it
displays, well agrees with this supposition. It was written

in Greek3 the Latin version, and the Syriac fragments, con-
tain abundant interna] evidence of a Greek origin. This
lauguage was adopted possibly, as Massuet says, because
the friend at whose request it was undertaken was a
Greek, but more probably because the Greek languagc
ns at that time more 'murmanis than the Latin3 also, the
Valentinian and Marcionita heresies that it meets, were
iar more destructively spread in the Euat and nt Alexandria
than in the West. There cau be little doubt but that its
title was that assigned to it by Eusebius, π. ἐλεγχοῦ καὶ
ἆνατροπῆς τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως. Andreas of Caesarea,
John oi Damascus, Photius, OEcumenius, and the Syrian

¹'l'hus lerourrus, though Bishop ol tho Port oi Rome, also choas the
Greek languagc as his medium,
