nothing need be said.

Our two principal sources of informetion with respect
to the Ophite system are Irenaeus‚ 1. xxviii, who repre·
sents the sect es in the highest degree cabbalistic; and
Hippolytus, who shews that they borrowed much of their
system from the seme Jewish source, though he terms it
Chaldaean; we learn from him that the Gnostic appelletion
was first assumed by the Ophites. Fortunately he does

Ι not go over the ground already covered by his predecessor,

buthe adds much curicus matter connecting the opinions
of this sect, the most ¹eclectie of cll the Gnostic brenches,
with the 'arcana of the heathen mysteries. The Ophites
made ³the triple division of Msn's Being into body, soul,
end spirit, and Hippolytus compares the several systcms
that recogniscd these component elements of Msn's complex
nature. Thus he refers to the Chaldaean lore their notion
of the prototypo] Men, who was ⁴alone os earth eorthy, and
of whom, ee yet unquickened by the soul of life, it wss
