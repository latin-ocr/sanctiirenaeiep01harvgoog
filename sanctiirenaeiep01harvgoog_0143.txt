series of five and of srx συζυγίαι evolved from the first
Ogdoad. Here again there was considerable discrepancy
in the several sections of thc Valentinian school. Irenaeus
says throughout, that Λόγος and Ζωη evolved the Decad,
while the Dodecad proceeded forth from Ἄνθρωπος and
Ἐκκλησία, whereas Hippolytus says that Νοῦς and Ἀλήθεια
sent forth the Deccd, the ¹Dodecad being the offset of
Λόγος and Ζωὴ. Reasons are assigned by him that give
rather an air of probability to this statement3 the names
also os the AEons are in harmony with it. He says, that
Νοῦς and ’Λλιίθειο perceiving that Λόγος and Ζωῆ possessed
the generative faculty, when Ἄνθρωπος and Ἐκκλησία were
evolved, evinoed their gratitude to the Suprcme by put-

because Bythus was the most perfect, as having evolrcd
by his own individual energy, the source and germ of the
entire Pleroma. Similarly Νοῦς and Ἀλήθεια being imper-

fect, as not possessing that power of independent produc·
tion, Λόγος and Ζωὴ honoured them with a series, but of

an ³impcrfect number, and put forth the Dodecad. Thus
the Deccd describes attributes and qualities that agree
closely with the hypothesis that they emanated from Nus;
and the male tcrms were Bythias, Ageratos, Autophyes,
Altinates, and Monogenem· while the feminine σόζυγοι are
suggestive of the intermingling, as it were, of the Finite
with the Infinite, with an anticipated solution of the result·
ing diseord in final harmony3 they were Maris, Honeste,
‘Hedona Syaoraais, and Macaria.
