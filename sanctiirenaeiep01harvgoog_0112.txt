them3 the former being the type ot* dawning light, the Ophites
latter of a world shrouded in darkness. Christ, therefore, οἶο-
queai acerram, et ia reperiam allevatitium, emanated from
eredundant overflow of the Divine Light, and in conjunc·
tion with the triple source of his subsistence formed the raa
prototypal Ecclesia of the Highest Heaven.

ΤΙιο mundane Sophia or Nae, finding no rest either in
heaven or earth, invoked the help of the Maternal spirit,
and obtained from the First Man, or Incorruptible AEon,
that Christ should be sent to her aid, and being united am
with her, should hy a combined descent upon iesus at his·
baptism, form thet Ecclesia on earth, which hed an eternst .
counterpart in the union of Christ with the Father, Son,
and Spirit in heaven. The συζυγία of Christ and Sophia
thus united with J esus, left him again upon his crucifixion‚
and the pryclie Man alone suffered death and was buried;
Christ however raised Jesus again from the dead, in a bodvers

that was animal and spiritual, but not alwio or earthy.
finally, those “holy souls” that had been endued with the
gift of Light were received by Christ aeated at the right
haud of Jaldabaoth‚ when released from the body3 while saa

the merely animal souls were sent back again into the world
for further purification. The false gospel of the Infancy
of Christ may have been intended by the writer to meet
tbe Ophite assertion that Jesus performed no miracle
either before his Baptiem or after his resurrection, that is. am.
while separate from the AEon Christ; although the draught
of fishes recorded by S. John, c. xxi.. was evidently
regarded by the disciples as miraculous.

We may observe in this tissue of absurdity the distort-
ed outline of one or two important Christian doctrines.
