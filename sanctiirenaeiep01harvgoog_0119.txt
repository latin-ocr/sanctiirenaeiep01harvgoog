nn theory In another point of view the definition that the world
cremnon. was ἐξ οὐκ ὄντων, was in direct antagonism with the Pla
tonic theory of etcrnally pre-existent ideas, and chaotic
matter: hut it harmoniscd with the Aristotelian reasoning,
whercby all substance having been divided into 1ριιιιω,
species, and thc iadicidaal, the ἄτομος or individual had
precedence, and was termed ἡ πρθτη οὐσία, and ἦ iacetani
οὐσία, because neither genus nor species ²could subsint
independently of the individual; these therefore were
seeoudary substances or 3δεύτεραι οὐσίαι. Thus primary
substance indicated some actual subsisting thing3 accendor-y
substance a mere quality, which cannot exist apart from
that which it qualifies. Hence before the creation of in-
dividual substance, so far as the world of matter was con·
cerned‚ *ἦν ὅλως οὐδέν. But the Deity isnot to be defined,
andis incomprehensible, and it was in this negative point
of view, and not at all in the language of atheism, that
Basilides set forth his idea of creation; οὑκ dv Oedr
ἀνοήτως, ἀναισθήτως, ἀβούλως, ἀπροαιρέτως, ἀπαθῶς, dvert-
θνμήτως, κόσμον ἠθέλησε ποιῆσαι. But he iustantly checks
this positive assertion‚ and gives it a symbolical meaning;

Td dd ἠθέλησε λέγω σημασίας χάριν, ἀθελήτως, καὶ ἀνοήτως
καὶ ἀναισθήτως, that is, as compared with human will, and
