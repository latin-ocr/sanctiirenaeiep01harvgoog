The Platonic theory of matter, also, harmonises with so Platonic
much as we know of Egyptian speculatione with respect to ,Ἐξ
that subject, so full of mystery to the heathen mind, and *-
the cause of so much inconsistent and inconelusive reason-
ing in the wisest toachers. 0f course we must not expect to
find anything like the Platonic refinements in these specu-
latious. For this reason we might pass over the abstruse
theory of Plato, if it were not very evident that it forms
the grouadwork of the Valentinian notion of the Demi-
urge and of the material creation. Matter, then, in the
system of Plato is considered in a threefold point of view;
oecupying space, it had an eternal subsistence as χώρα or
τόπος, the formal vehiculum of matter devoid of organisa-
tion or order. But unorganised matter, thus comprehendcd
within determinate limits, had eternally a bodily nature;
aud that which is corporeal is subject to change; therefore,
antecedently to its organisation by the Creator, matter
was for ever iu a transitionsl state, and passing from one
ehadtic condition-void of order, to another. To these
two phasee sueoeeded now a third, in which matter was
organised, and its erratio tendencies brought under the
Divine rule of form and order by a μέθεξις, or adunation
with the ideal types, that had subsisted eternally in the
Divine mind; but ia this again we traee Pythagorean and.
Platonic theories back to one common source3 Aristotle
evidently identifies the two systems with each other, as
virtually one, in saying, oi Πυθαγόρειοι μιμήσει vd ὄντα
φασὶν εἶναι τῶν α’ριθμῶν, Πλάτων δὲ μεθέξει. Met. 1. 6.

Now if Plato borrowed anything from Egypt, the more
ancient portions of Egyptian teaching‚ without doubt, are
to he sought in the myths that have been preserved to us;
and the main features of the Platonic theory of matter are
disceruible iu an Egyptian fable recorded by Plutarch.
The substantial eternity of matter, its acosmic corporeity,
and its subsequent organisation, when the passive power
