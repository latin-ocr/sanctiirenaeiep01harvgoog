Ophites.

hc has engrafted a strangely unsatisfactory account. If it·
be considered improbable that so considerable a develop
ment of Gnosticism as the Monadic theory, owed its origin
to a youth who died at the early age of ¹sevcnteen, the
probability will also follow, that Carpocrates was not the
first to style himself Gnostic, but that the Ophites, as
Hippolytus states, first assumed the name. And thiais
the next system that presente itself for consideration.

The assertion of Philostrius that the Ophites formed a
sect before the time of Christ, an idea adopted by ’Mos
heim, cannot fora moment hold its ground, in presence of
the additional light that we now derive from the φιλοσο-
φούμενα of Hippolytus, ³wh0 says that they made frequent
reference to the words of Christ; in fact their quotations
⁴from Scripture, and especially from S. John, must refer
them to the close of the first century, or the beginning of
the secoud; in the early part of which they certainly
existed as a distinct sect. The name Oplite is the equiva-
lent of ὅΝαασσηνοί, derived from the word fiili, ipa.
But that root, as a ⁶verb‚ is the voa solennia whereby
the exercise of magical imposture is designated; and it
occurs in this sense in deseribing the addiction of Ma-
nasses to forbidden arta, in apposition with Dlllil'gl'„
yvaierac, wizarda. It is not improbable therefore, that the
adherente of this sect were originally called Naassenes
