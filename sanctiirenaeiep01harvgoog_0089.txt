every shadc of allegory, and mysticism in its wildest
mood. Again, the same writer records the Ophite gloss
upon the LXX version of Jer. xvll. 9: ’Ἄνθρωπος ἐστι rai
τίς ’γνώσεται αὖτόν.” Οὕτως, φησίν, ἐστὶ πάνυ βαθεῖα καὶ

δυσκατάληπτος ἦ τοῦ τελείου ἀνθρώπου γνῶσις. Ἀρχῆ γάρ,

φησὶν, τελειώσεως, γνῶσις ἁνθρῶπου’ Θεοῦ δὲ γνῶσις, ἀπηρ-

τισμένη τελείωσις. Τοο passage occurring in a cento of
allegorical expositious, sufficiently explains the Ophite
meaning of the term γνῶσις.

Now bearing in mind the teste for allegory that had
been fostered ογ the old heathen mysteries, this term ap
pears to have been of a very natural growth. Charged
to the full, as they were, with gross and debasing super·
stition, andevera worse, these mystic perversions still ori·
ginated in some remote core of truth; whereby generally
the varied relations of the Divine Bcing with respect to
the world of his creation were designated3 and unsophis
ticated truths, that subsisted in the saith of a patriarchal
age, were gradually debased and lowered by admixturc
with a ceremonial that addressed itself to the mere animal

v. ,μμ principle of the multitude. S. Augustin perhaps spoke of

the Samothracian mysteries in irony, οε, nobilia Samothra·
cum system,- and yet certain really noble ideas of the
Deity in many instances gave a starting point to such
mysteries‚ and early teaehers thought to fix these by the
medium of allegories, around which the grossest absurdities
were only too sure to accruc. In these mysterics all had
an allegorical interpretation. The remote sense was shut
up, μεμυημένον, from the multitude; it was disclosed only to
the initiatcd, who were then τελειοόμενοι, and had nothing
more to learn. But such a system naturally led to the
multiplicatiora of allegory, and devotees who possessed the
key to this figurative teaohing, arrogated to themselves a
adesce, or γνῶσις, that was denied to the many.

These three very distinct bearings of the term γνῶσις,
