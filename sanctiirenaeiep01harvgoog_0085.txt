Roapitula highcr degree than the vain wrangling of the schools, the
-¹-¹⁰¹¹·- natural result shewed itsclf in a recurrence to those an-
cient and comparatively unsophisticated principles os the
old world, that were antecedent to the various systema of
philosophy, and that still maintained a dim subsistence in
the old centres of civilisation. Hence the Gnostic claimed to
take his stand upon the ιδιδασκαλιίι α’νατολικῆ, and upon the
'Chaldaic Lenming, as the ³Aneient Philosophy. We have
observed alsa, as existing in Egypt, clear traces of a belief
in ⁴One Supreme Deity, who had existed from all eternity
⁵in a mode that is inconceivable to the human intellect, and
was therefore termed negatively 6σκότος ἄγνωσῆον. That
from this Supreme Being were evolved, in the way of
emanation, a subordinate pair of δαιμόνια, ¹lsis and Osiris,
who represented the ¹·Divine ἰδέαι, or Σοφία the ⁹Mother
of crestion‚ and the male or ¹⁰plastic energy of the Crea-
tive Principle; while a third emanative Divine Person,
florus, embodicd these archetypal ideas in the world of
matter. The first substance evolved was ¹¹Light3 and
every product of Creation was the representative of a
transcendentsl ”strab in the Divine Ideas. Matter, of
eternal subsistence‚ ¹³ existed in a chaotic state, as ¹⁴ Plato
also imagined‚ until reduced into order by its μέθεξις

The Egyptian grouping of the deitics in subordination
to the Supremo, corresponds in order, and in part also
numerically with that of the Valentinian AEons3 and was

based apparently upon certain ¹⁶arithmetioal analogica,
