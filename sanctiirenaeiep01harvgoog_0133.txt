from the common type. The broader features of this
scheme are plainly discerniblc in the Basilidian theory,
and independently of historical evidence, the comparative
simplieity of this latter sully justifies the assumption that
it was prior in point of date. Thus the οὑκ ὢν Garis of
Basilides was too severe an abstraction to be appre-
ciated by the many, and it became in his suceessor's
definition, the abysmal silence,¹Bv0‹ir and Σιγιὶ, from whence
not only the creative word had not yet been evolved, but
to which no single definite notion of the human mind could
as yet apply. Not even the term Νοῦς could be predi·
eated of it, when as yet nothing existed for it to act upon.
The fundamental notion is wholly similar. Then again
the universe, whether of inteltipiblea or senates, in either
case fell into three distinct classes, and the ²e'mpnver'n τοῦ
οὐρανοῦ of Basilides was the Pleroma of his successor; the
lowermost system was the astrologieal Hebdomad, in which

a divine life and energy was attributed to the planetary
worlds, as in the ³Platonie and ⁴Philonic ⁵Hebdomads3

though the notion is traced back to ⁶Chaldaea by Bardesanes.
The intermediate system was naturally the Oydood in both
