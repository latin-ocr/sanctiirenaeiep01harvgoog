Achamoth now separate from grosser passion, conceived,
from the vision of the Saviour's augelic retinue, the spiritual
principle, afterwards infused into the elect souis. The origin

of all created substance, matter, soul, and spirit, is thus
accounted for, ἐν loripes: the formation of the first two
principles was within the province of Achamoth, that of
the latter was beyond her power, as having like herself
emanated from the Pleroma, but eudued with that essen·
