xxiv EGYPT.

:1100 ic natural produci, as the narse arad comprehensive principle
‘nai' '⁰⁸1 (πανδεχής) in Plato. But by the many she is called tha

milliari-named, for moulded (τρεπομένη f.l. τυπουμένη) by
reason she ernbraces all forms and ideas. And con-
genital with her is Lovc of the first and nrightiest of all,

, which is one and the same with the Good; this she desires

and follows after, but she avoids and repels all participation
with Evil, being to both indeed as space and matter, but
inclining always of her own accord to the better prin-
ciple, occasioning in it the procreative impulse of insemi-
nating her with emanatione and types in which she rejoices
and exults, as impregnated with produce. For produce is
the material image of Substance, and the contingentis
an imitation of that which IS¹.''

Further‚ the Egyptian mythology indicates the remote
origin of the Valentinian classification of the Pleroma into
three groupcs. For Herodotus speaks of a similar distribu-
tion of Egyptian deities²; 'liv Ἕλλησι μέν νυν νεώτατοι τῶν
θεῶν νομίζονται εἶναι Ἡρακλῆς τε καὶ Διόνυσος καὶ lla'v· παρ’
Αἰγυπτίοισι δὲ lleiv μὲν ἀρχαιότατος, καὶ τῶν <irad τῶν
πρώτων asponiam θεῶν· Ἡρακλῆς δὲ τῶν δευτέρων, τῶν
δυώδεκα λεγομένων εἶναι· Διόνυσος δὲ τῶν τρίτων, oi ἑκ τῶν
δυώδεκα θεῶν ἐγένοντο. This third groupe of deities were
possibly the ³five born of Rhea, marking the additiones
five days to the year of 360. The dodecad emanated
from tho ogdoad, ‘c’r τῶν darei θεῶν ol elodiana deal
ἐγένοντο, τῶν Ἠρακλέα ἕνα νομίζουσι. But the ogdoad was

the primary groupe, 5τους δὲ ὁκτώ deols τούτους προτέρους

τῶν δυώδεκα θεῶν φασι γενέσθαι. Now the Egyptian sacred
philosophy presented a complex phasis; it exhibited in one
point of view a belief in one divine emanative principle,
and in another it was a symbolical representation of the
