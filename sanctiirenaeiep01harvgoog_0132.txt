The schools of Grecce and Basilides furnished most marcant
of the leading ideas in his system; and even his notion Q
of two coutending principles, that is usually connected
with the East, is much more suggestive of Plato and

Ι Pythagoras. The Bishop of Portus indeed has described

.' Valentinus as a ¹follower of these two philosophers. The
peculias method however in which this heretic dealt with
the notions of philosophy, with reference to the cosmo·
gony, was essentially Oriental; aad we can trace back
to no other original than the Persian Amshaspands and
Ferouers, his system of AEons, or consecutive emana-
tions from One Divine Principle of Unity; though even
these may be compared with the numerical harmonias
of Pythagoras, and his evolution of male and female
numbers.

Strong points of similarity may be observed between
the respective hypotheses of Valentinus and Basilides.
Reproduction was of the very essenoe of Gnostioism; and
asin these systema every created substance was imagined
to have had an antecedent elada, of which it was the irni-
tation, so also the consecutive theorias themselves, that
formed so prominent a feature in the history of the second
century, were little else than a varied modification of one
or two leading ideas, the gencric characteristica of a com-
mon stock. Basilides however was the philosopher, and
addressed himself to the learned3 Valentinus was rather
the poet, and clothed the Gnostic system, that he found
ready tobis hand, in a mythological dress, that was more
likely to prove attractive to the fancy of the many.
Hence his system acquircd a rapid popularity. In tho
East, iu the West, and in tha South, it spread with re-
markable rapidity, though with considerable variatione
