opuscula. main work of Irenaeus contains no clear quotation from
‘'—this epistle, that may certainly be referred to it; and for
this reason perhaps, Eusebius, as fully believing its eanoni-
cal authority, adduces Irenaeus, an unexeeptionable witness
upon asubject that had not passed unqueetioned iu Western
Christendom. Eusebius mentions no other works of Ire·
naeus, but ¹his words seem intended to convey the notion,
that other writings may have been extant in the West,
that had not yet become known to himin Palestine;
accordingly his expression cannot justify the exclusiou
from our list, of works represented by fragments that
have come down to us. Such for example is the quota-
tion from a treatise de Resurrectioae Dominieu, found ina
namna Syriae, and, in an interpolated form, in an Armenian ver·
sion3 the high antiquity of the Syriae MS. in which this
passage is found, and it was written an. 562, is to a cer·
tain extent a voueher for the genuineness of its original;
internal evidence shews that the longer extract in the
Armenian contains a considerable interpolation, and that
the Syriae is the most faithful to the lost Greek text.
Maximus quotes two detaehed sentences from a work to
'Demetrius de Fide, which is passed over in silence both by
Eusebius and Jerome; the Latin translation also of the
fragment received by Feuardent from Faber, who obtained
it from some collection now unknown, is from a Sermon
ad Demetrium. It is by no means unlikely that the
treatise inscribed to Demetrius should both bave been
unknown to Eusebius when he wrote his history, and have
become so rare in the time of S. J erome as to have escaped
his notice: its inscription to a deacon of Vienne‚ marks

that it was of a purely elementary character, it was a
