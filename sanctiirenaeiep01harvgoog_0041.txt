Plato; for Ormuzd was the personified idea of all things
create, eternally subsisting in the Divine Unity. The enun-

was the prototypa of the Marcosian Word, the divine
fugue, that continuing through every possible combine·

appointed to run out at length, and subside in a perfect
and eternal harmouy.

But evil was also evolved coordinately with Ormuzd.
The moral aud physical world, taken in its reality, presented
antagonising principles on its surfece and in its depth, that
could not escape notice; and philosophy must give its
account of everything. God indeed has revealed to man
that evil is his discipline, to bc overruled under certain
conditione for eventual good; but, without the aid of reve·
lation, men have endeavoured in various ways to account for
the evil that is mixed up with man's destiny, and so affects
the happiness of life. An implacable Nemesis, traching
down ancestral sin through successive generations; a blind
fate, the exact converse of ·reasoning Will; the necessary
sequence of events, as unvarying as the revolution of Ixion's
wheel, are theorias that have been successively developed,
as the only possible way of accounting for the evil to
which manis born. Τὴθ Persian started from the same
