γε’νωμαι, μήτε ἦν μηδὲν ἔτι ᾦ. Even if μετά των θεῶν had Early
been the words used, it would have been by no means effici
certain that the tcrm wns intended to convey a polytheistic ““““““
notion. If the Hebrew plural term Ε’ῗίὲξᾷ be inexpliceble,
are we bound to affirm that the term θεοί must of necessity
involve the notion of a plurality in the Divine Substence?
Peneo scarcely used the term as the poet or the mytholo-
giam adeone me delirare ουιςεε, ut ista credam? might have
been the language of Croeso, if esked whether his apos·
trophe to the Dii immortales included the entire conclave
of the Olympian deities.

Agnin, the firm stand that the Persians mede against
the idolatrous usages of the Greeks, is good proof thet
polytheism was never their creed. The entire vault of
heaven was to them us the Deity, τᾶν κύκλον πάντα τοῦ emcnrn,
οὐρανοῦ Aa& καλέοντες. The Greeks, also as belonging
to the seme Anien stock, exhibit something of the same
primitive Faith, end the Hesiodic Muses celebrate Earth

und Heaven ns the source of all, Τίνος. 44,

θεῶν γεύος αἰδοῖον πρῶτον κλείουσιν αόιθῇ

ἐξ ἀρχῆς, οὓς Γαΐα καί cipando εὖριίς ἔτικτον.

Eussmns says of the oldest form of religious belief, οὐκ ἄρα {ww

nine. The ancient Greek symbolised with the Persicus,
wh0, as Hnnononns reconde, ἀγάλματα καί υηοιίς καί βωμοιίς 1. ιω.
οὖκ ε’ν νόμῳ ποιευμένους ἱδρύεσθαι, ἀλλά καί τοῖσι ποιεῦσι

ἐνόμισαν τούς θεοιίς κατάπερ οἱ Ἕλληνες εἶναι. So again
Diogenes Laertius, Tode le* μάγους.. . ἀποφαίνεσθαι περί τε noem.
οὐσίας θεῶν καί γενέσεως, οὓς καί πῦρ εἶναι καί γῆν καί ὕδωρ·
