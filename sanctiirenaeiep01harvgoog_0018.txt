Book and the opening chapters of the second, have
been presumed to express his collation of some ancient
MS.; but this is far from certain. Some of the cor- '
rections are manifest conjectures. In any case the
original source of them was never known. The same
degree of doubt scarcely applica to the readings marked
by Grabe as Mero. 1. and 11. They are noted in the
Erasmian Edition belonging to the Leyden Library,
and were used by Stieren. The readings marked 1.
specify the testimony of one of two copies ; while 11.

not appear that one copy was marked 1. and the
other 11.

Erasmus put forth three editions of Irenaeus in the
years 1526, 1528, 1534 ; and after his death, Stieren
enumeratas as many as seven reprints of the original
edition between 1545 and 1570, when the editiones

preceded Grabe in 1702'. In Grabe's Oxford Edition

considerable additions were made both 10 the Greek

original, and fragments ; aud the text was greatly

improved by a collation of the Arundel MS. with addi-
tions from the Ood. Voss. Ten years later the Bene-
dictine edition appeared similarly enriched with the
