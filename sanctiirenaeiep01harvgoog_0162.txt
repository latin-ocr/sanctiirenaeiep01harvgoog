lived, ci ιιοιι costa caute tomen, aud paid a greater regard
Ι lo appearances than m the provinces3 for it is remarkable
that the Bishop of Portus, following as he so frequently
Ι doesthe account of henaeus,and transcrihing long extracta,
stops short at these charges of immorality3 as though he
could not hear witness to the truth of the picture, so far as
it had been presented to his own personal observation,
amid the realities of life. One very remarkable feature in
the work of S. Hippolytus‚is the care that he takes not to
sully his page with topics that it must always pain the
Christian to read. For this reason we also may omit
those details upon Valentinian and Marcosian immoralities‚
that followed in natural course from their ideas of inde·
iectiblc privilege.
The Valentinian view of inspiration was quite consistent
with the rest of the system. For the government and
dispositim of the affairs of life were wholly under the
guidmce of Demiurge, whose profound' ignorance of every
thing above his sphere prevented him from having any know·
ledge of the spiritual substance imparted by Achamoth3
upon the principle indicated hythe Apostle, ψυχικὰς δι’ 1001. ιι. ιι

something, however, intrinsically beautiful in the spiritual
pinciple that commended it to his regard; and those into
whom it was infused were advanced by him to pre-emi·
hence, as Propheta, Priests, and Kings. But the spirits of
the propheta though subject to the prophete, were no
rsuhjects of the Demiurge3 hence they uttered indifferently
l that which was dictated by Achamoth, as in the sugges·
tions of the seed they bore within, as well as the psychic
and merely natural ideas that their human soul derived ¹⁰il' aas,
