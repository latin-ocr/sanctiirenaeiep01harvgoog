3 nto Himself His own Thought, so also the revcale d Thought
Q acted not otherwise, but seeing Him she hid within herself
the Father, which rs the Power; thus Thought also rs a
bisexual Power, so that in this way they mutually cor·
respond; for Power differs in no respect from Thought,

theory. The Brahminical simile of the tortoise putting
forth, and withdrawing its limbs from heneath the testudo,
at the present day, exemplifies it. But with greater subtle-
ty, the Samariten Mage drevv his illustration from that,
which is at once the loftiest exponent of Power upon
earth, the highly composite system of a most perfect
Unity, the Mind of Man Another particular, that should
