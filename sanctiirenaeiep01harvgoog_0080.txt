tinctured with the cosmopolitan character of the place. Q
It no longer represented the schools of Hellas; and even·
tually a system grew up, formed upon the eclectio prin-'
ciple of sharing the distinetive peculiarities of all. This
fusion, so far astho Greek modes of philosophy are eon-
oemed, is originally associated with the name of Potamon
by ¹D1oonnns Lauretum although he reduced into order
rather, and systematised the eclectio principle, whereby
already ’Anrrocaus had united the Academie and Stoic
toaching3 Sranno, the geographer, had harmonised the
latter with the Peripatetie meth0d3 sonos, the younger,
had combined Stoicism with the ancient theory of Pr-
ruaoonns3 and Autronius of the Academy had brought
together the great rival theories of Pmro and Anrsrornu.
Awider application of the same eclectio principle was
soon made3 the teaohing of the East was incorporated
and naturalised; so that the Magi of Chaldaea and of
Persia, the disciple of Prrnrooms, and the more subtle
disputants of the Academy, of the Lyceum, and of the
Porch, were represented in that susion of the various in-
tellectual and religious systema of theold world, which has
made the llluseum famous³. Το these also must be added
the J ewish philosophy, or Cebbala, derived originally from
Babylon, and modified by later misappreoiations of Pr·
rnaaonas and Pmro. A few observations upon this
latter clement, (system it can scarcely be called) will lead

to a consideration of the Gnostie theory of the first two
