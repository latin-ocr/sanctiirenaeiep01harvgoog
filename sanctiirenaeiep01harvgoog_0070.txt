rergy.

This harmony, symmetry‚ proportion, or whatever else
ythagoras may have termed the ultimate principle of

'asystem was as the ¹Divine Soul of the whole; it was

*action upon its own nature it evolvcd the Dyad, the
nnbol of matter, the fruitful mother of an infinite evolu-
onal series of products; while the ³Monad, sole origin of
world of harmonies, and wholly abstracted from matter,

Further, these numerical laws and properties were
onsidered‚ not only to have a definite relation to the
articular combinatione or powers in which they were
bserved‚ but to have an universal subsistence, an wara·

‚ifferent elements as numbers and a plane geometrica}

roperty or power whose more extended relations it is
