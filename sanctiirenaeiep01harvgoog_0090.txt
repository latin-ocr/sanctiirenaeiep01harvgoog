observed in the Philosophia, Oriental, and Mystical systema, Fauonio
are not unfrequently combined in a writer, who was the maa.
immediate precursor of Gnosticism at Alexandria, the
philosophica} and mystic minded Philo J udeeus. They arc
exemplified in a passage in his treatise de Samnite, in which
he discourses upon the angelic vision in Bethel, aud ima-
gines the mid air to be peopled, as some teeming city,
with souis, and spirits, aud angels. He allegorises from
revealed data, and his allegory is by uo means unworthy of
Plato, either in ita beauty, or in the riches of moral and
intellectual knowledge that it declares to be within the
reach of man. At the same time the spiritual entities
that it represents as peopling the air, aud the ¹completc
sublimatiou of the contemplative spirit, are purely Zoro-
astrian. Indead Philo for ever speaks in the spirit of an
eclectio Gnosticism, without, so far as Ι am aware, ever
making use of the term γνῶσις, otherwise than in the con·
ventional meaning of the word; a good proof perhaps that
in his day the term had not yet been restricted to express
the tenets of any particular sect. As is often to be ob-
served in the history of the human intellect‚ opinions long
lloat in a loose and disengaged form, ready to coalescc
and crystallise arouud the first convenient nucleus, until
at length circumstances present themselves that are favour-
able to the process3 and theories that had long subsistcd
become known by some appropriate name, and gain their
place in history. Very much of this character appears to
have been the origin of Gnosticism at Alexandria; and
modes of expression were adopted even in ²ecclcsiastieal
