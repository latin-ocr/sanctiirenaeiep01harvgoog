eye, and the various parts of the orgen of vision, to convey not aaa
sensation to the hrain. Even Plato had only approaohed effide
the margin of this intermediate void; Aristotle’s subtlety „-
had been foiled by it; but it was reserved for the new

fusion of philosophioal schools, in the eclectio system of
Alexandria, to resolve the difficulty, negatively‚ by deny-

ing that there was any such void to be bridged over, and
positively, by asserting the complete oncness of Trutb with

the Intellect. Plotinus expressed only the theory of bis iiim!
¹precursors when he¹ affirmed that “ Intelligence is at once ξ’σξψ
the object conceived, the subject conceiving, and the aetum'm'h
of conception ;” ²in his words, οὑκ ἔξω τοῦ νοῦ rd νοητά.

Porphyry disputed the position, not because it was gffiffi

novel or strange, but that he might draw out the
master upon a subject of philosophie interest. Thus the
absolute unity of the Thinking Mind with the entities
that it conceives, was one great distinguishing tenet of
the Alexandrian or NeoPlatonic school of philosophy;
and it very evidently coincided with the notion of the
Gnostic heresiarcha, that a true γνῶσις can only subsist in
souls that by a divine insemination are derived from and
return to the κόσμος νοητός, the Pleroma of Intelligenoe.
Other points indicate a Western source for oemain main
tenets of Gnostic theosophy; ’the trouble of tracing out
these analogias has generally been avoided by assuming
that all such tenets had an Oriental parentage; but a brief
review of the component elementa of the Alexandrian
philosophy, and a comparison of the prinoipal Gnostic
tenete, will shew which of these tenete are referrible to an
Enstern, and which of them to a Wcstern origin.

The Alexandrian philosophy then was principally dis·
tinguished by the larger infusion of Pythagorean notions
