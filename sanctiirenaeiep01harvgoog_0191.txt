Psaffim book, now known under the well ventilated nenne of Hip
,Q polytus3 and the vor. lect. in question are noted in Miller's
'‘- edition of the Philosophunoena.

Itis unneeessery to enter further into this eurious his·
tory of the Fragmenta Amodata, than to state that Maffei,
who had a subsequent opportunity of visiting and inspeet-
ing the collection, ¹disagreed with Pfaff with respect to
the genuineness cf these fragments, but never denied their
existenee; they disappeared therefore after his second
visit. Pfaff answered this critique from Tubingen, and with
the exception of a second paper of Maffei, 1716, for many
years he heard no more upon the subject of the Turin
MSS„ until the Benedictine edition of Irenaeus was reprint·
ed at Venice in 1734. He was attaeked in it upon other
points; but his good faith ae regards the existence of
these Aaecdota remained unimpeached. The Fragments
therefore are offered to the reader, as possessing ²good

external authority, and far more convincing internal proof
of genuineness, thau can always be expected in such brief
extracto.

Ιι may be added that the reader is indebted to the
Spieilepiam Salsamenta of M. Pitra, for the Armenian
extracta, the last that demand our notice.
