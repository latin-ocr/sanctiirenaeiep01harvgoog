Q world was destined to continue, until the Filial principle,
that had been left to receive and reflect benefit among
the souls of the unformed mass, having been formed and

Now, wild as this scheme may bc, as compared with
Divinc Truth, there is scarcely anything more wild in it
than in the statements of Plato, respecting the Nature ol
the Deity, of the Universe, and of man. The Basilidian
scheme presented a resume of the then current, as well as
