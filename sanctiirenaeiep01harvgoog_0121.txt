Light the heavenly bodies were formed. Similarly Basilides imagined
,Q a triple distinction in the constitution of the universe.
Ἦ There was the lower world, of gross material principles;
the upper world or ὑπεμκόσμια, corresponding with the
πέμπτη οὐσία of Aristotle; and intermediately was the
ἀκρωρεῖον, or μεθόριον πνεῦμα, the spirit moving between

the confines of both.
The first material principle iu the Basilidian, as in the
Mosaic theory, was light; but then, as in the Persian Cos·
mogony, it was the seed from whence every other material

clement was evolved; it was, as Ormuzd, the word of
Light and Life¹; and the addition of a text from S. John
complctes the amalgam of notions horrowed from Greek
philosophy aud Zoroaster on the one hand, and from
Moses and the Gospel ou the other; for this material
principle was the 12·an that liqirert every man that
comest into tte world. We shall have occasion to observe
in the sequel a further application of this Zoroastrian
principle.

So far the system we have been traciug was not more
remote from divine truth than many of the allegorical
notions of Philo; but from this point a wilder note is
soundcd, and dogmata ore advauced that the 'heresiarch
himself appears to have referred tono higher inspiration
than his own vain imaginatiou. The power of 3δονι-Ιιοοά (if
