νοοίης With respect to his Christolcgy, the miraculous con·
Q ception of Christ having been described in accordaucc
with the general tenour of his scheme, Basilides varied
nothing in the Gospel account of the ¹ministry of Christ3
as the birth of the Saviour however was represented hy the
heretic from his own peculiar point of view, so also was
his death. For here again hc declared, that the 2 material
body of Jesus, having been subject to a truc passion,
returned to the ἀμορφία from whence it was taken; hut
that the psyctic substance, as pertaining to the sphere ol
the mundane soul, the Hebdomod, was restored to that
region3 and ³the spiritual notare to the Opdocd, as belong-
ing to the μεθόριον πνεῦμα. Irenaeus however states that
‘Basilides denied the Passion of Christ; Simon of Cyrene
having been substituted for him on the crosa. This hov-
ever is in direct antagonism with the heresiarch's words
quoted by Clement, which state that Christ suffered like
any other martyr3 and the instance is valuable, as shewing
that hearscy evidence, even from the Fathers, is to be

taken with the mica salis puri.

we may observe thatd οὑκ ὧν Orda and seven attributes
constituted an Οράοοά, which was reflected in the lower
ogdoad properly so called. These emanations werc not
put forth in pairs, but as in the ⁵Zoroastriau theory, in
