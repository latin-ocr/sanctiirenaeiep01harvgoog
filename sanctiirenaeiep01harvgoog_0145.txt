Enthyme. notion as it arises may be referred with a tolerable degree

-.-fii-,of certainty to its origin, sometimes in the Oriental
theosophy, sometimes in the Jewish Cabbala, but far
more frequently in the Greek philosophy.

We turn now to a scarcely less abstruse subject, the
Valentinian account of the Creation of the world. It may
be premised that it agrees neither with the philosophical
notion that matter is etcrnal, simply because nothing can
come of nothing; nor with the later Oriental view, that
matter is the matrix of the evil principle, eternally coex-
isting with Suprema good, and contending for the mastery;
on the contrary, Bythus, in the beginning, was a solitary
obstructiora, and it was only after many successive emana-
tions, that 'matter was brought. to the birth. There wasa
recognition of the Eastcrn principle, so far as it was
thought impossible that gross matter should be evolved
immediately from that which is purely spiritual substance
but virtually the Mosaic account was adopted, that God
created the Hcaven and Earth, and all the generations of
them; and so far, as we have seen, the Basilidian system
also agreed. The Valentinian theory then exhibits the
following notions. In the first place ²Love was the impul·
silc principle that caused thc emission of the Only-begot
ten Νοῦς, and Ἀλήθεια, anda Divine 3ἑνθνίιιησις was its
mode. But 4Γνῶσις was the substance in which Νοῦς was
evolvctl3 and that which in Bythus was an impulsive Lore,

developing itself in the Divine conception, was ⁵engendered
