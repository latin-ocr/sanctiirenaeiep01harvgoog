mcaa, and Tertullian in his Treatise c. Valentinum.
The notions against which the great work of Irenaeus
was directed, have so many points cf contact with
Greek philosophy, that occasional illustrations from
this source have been found necessary. A point of
some interest will be found of frequent recurrence in
the notes; which is, the repeated instanccs that Scrip-
tural quotations afford, of having being made by one
who was as familiar with some Syriae version of the
