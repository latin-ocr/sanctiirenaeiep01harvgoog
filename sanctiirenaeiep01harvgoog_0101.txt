Ebionites.

rise in Palestine. As regards the birth of Christ, it symbol-
ised with cerinthum presenting a compound, of “¹imper-
fect Christianity and imperfect J udaism.” These Ebionites
said, that Christ was a mere title of superior virtue, which
was equally within the reach of any strict observer os the

Law. They kept 'consecutively the J ewish Sabbath, and
the Lord’s day; but in this they only continued the prac-
tice of the earliest Christiane, and the custom was not
entirely superseded, until the Church, by a definite canon,
had condemned the practice as marking a ³Judaising spirit.
The rite of circumcision was retained by them, and the
creation of the world was ascribed by them to the
Supreme Deity. Theodoret says that Symmachus, who
translated the Hebrew Scriptores into Greek, was an

1 Ebionite; accordingly we find the word νεᾶνις in 1s.vii.14.

Os the New Testament the entire volume was rejected by
the Ebionites; the ⁴Gospel of the Hebrews having been
substituted for the Greek Gospel of S. Matthew; S. Paul,
as an apostate from the Law, was an objectos bittcr dis-
like to them, and his Epistlcs were altogether rejected.

ει- rx a The assertiones Epiphanius that S. John wrote his Gospel

to meet Ebionite error, is only so far important, as shew-
ing the writer's belief that the hcresy was antecedent to
the Evangelist in point of time.

We arc only concerned with the Gnostic scats, as they
presented themselves to the notice of Irenaeus, and it
will not be necessary to consider any subsequent divari-
cation of the Ebionite branch, of which he appears to
have known nothing. We may pass on therefore to the
next sect in our chronological series.
