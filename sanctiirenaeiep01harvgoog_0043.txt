Hebrew of men were created, as wellas thc lower world of matter.

Q The words of Bmusonas refer these oriental theories to the
highest antiquity, and their supportem connected them

The question arises how these theorias, presenting
in some respects certain analogies with a truer theology‚
became known in Persia. If, indeed, Zoroaster were ae·
quainted with the Hebrew scripturas, aa Arabio writers

{guffie- affirm, who also say that he was born in Palestine, we
might understand that portions of his system would very
fairly be referrible to the great foresather of the Jews.
But the close eontact into which the Hebrew portion of
the Shemitie racc had been brought with the Iranian
stock, owing to the Babylonian captivity, would account
sor any degree of resemblance observable between the
Zoroastrian system, and the august theology of the Jews.
Possibly the liturgica] portion os the Zend Avesta may
be the production of Zoroaster; the Zend, or sacred
language oi the Medion Magi, carries on the face of it
a considerable antiquity, while the latter, and more sci-
entific portious being composed‚ not in Zend, but Pehlevi,
the language of the Sassanian dynasty, and of the Par-
thians, betray as clearly a later origin. Hence whatever
knowledge this portion of the Zend Avesta exhibita of the
Hebrew Scriptures, may be more properly referred to the
eo-presenee of the Jewish religious system with the tra-
ditional saith os Persia, subsequently to the Christian era.
