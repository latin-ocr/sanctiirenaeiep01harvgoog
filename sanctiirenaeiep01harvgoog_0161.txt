Μειί triple division of his nature into body, soal, and spirit, those

(ιᾚζ that were under bondage to the first, or the cloio, were

wholly out of the reaeh of salvation3 the psyctic or animal

' maa, as the Church Catholic was called, was only so far

salvabis, aa he made choice for himself of good, ἐὰν τὰ

βελτίονα ἕληται· but then there was no admission for

him into the Pleroma; he had his Rest iu the Mean, or

Μεσότης, where Achamoth for the present received the

souls of the Just; and whither Demiurge, upon her final

promotion to the Pleroma, should ascend after the lower

worlds had passed away. But if the animal man made

choice of evil, his eternal lot was, χωρήσειν πρὸς τὰ ὅμοια,

i. a. like the choic, εἰς τήν φθοράν. Tm spiritual, that

is Valentinian heretica, alone were admitted into the

Pleroma, from whence their origin was dated; for ‘at

the final restitution of all things, Achamoth and the

spirits that had been transfused by her into the world,

should he admitted into the Pleroma, and mated with

&2¹³³ the angela, their consorte. N umerically therefore the

{cavana sum of the elect was κατ’ α’ριθμδν ἀγγέλων Θεοῦ. The

saul however, or mere animal and intellectual principle,

had no entrance into the Pleroma, it was divested of

the spirit, as of the body, and remained without ἐν

· μεσότητι, with Demiurge and the other souls of the just

The souls of men therefore alone, as occupying the mean

between the carnal and the spiritual, were capable of a

two-sold division, accordingly as they inclined to the higher

or the lower principle; the better souls might receive the

seed, the worse never. The spiritual principle and the

material were respectively sai pencris, they were both
inconvertible and incapable of further modification.

ι The moral effect of such doctrine was pernicious inthe

extreme3 Irenaeus gives a darlr picture of its working

within his own immediate observation, and such as the

heresy was on the hanks of the Rhone‚ it also was in Asia
