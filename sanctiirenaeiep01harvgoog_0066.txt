pabulum. The same half century that saw the Magian Ηοη·
worship of lire established 1n the east by Zoroast t,er as the clitus
purast material emblem of the deity, found Heraclitus of
Ephesus giving a similar direction to the philosophical seara
mind in Asia Minor, by asserting that lire was the first
principle. Either teacher worked the aelf-same notion

up into form, making it a symbol, the one of a re-
ligious, the other of a philosophioal creed.

Heraclitus, as a native of a highly volcanic region, the
κατακεκαομένη of the ancients, naturally enough adopted
this theory. It does not appear to have made many
converts, though his speculatione in other respects had
considerable intluence upon the fortunas of philosophy.
The Stoica built upon his foundation; Plotinus applied
his theory, for if Heraclitus said that the Deity was πυρ
νοερόν, the founder of the Neo· Platonic school also taught pp rapo p.
that the Divina blind acted on matter through the eternal
ideas, by an intimate combination‚ as the secret energy
ol' lire, ¹the Divina Ideal being a fiery efflux. In other
respecta Heraclitus had his points of contact with Zoroas-
ter3 Discord, or πόλεμος, was as his Alarimam and the idea
of multiplicity in unity is contained in his dictam, that
unity 'divided out ia a aelf-combination‚ 'vd «ydp ἔν φησι
διαφερόμενον, alul αὐτῷ ξυμφέρεσθαι. He gave a prece-
dent to Gnostic sels-eoneeit, in affirming, αὑτὸν τοὶ πάντα
εἰδέναι roris dd ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους οὐδέν. Simon Magne,
though in the spirit rather of oriental theosophy‚ asserted
a fiery first principle, which was afterwards inherited from
him by tbe Marcionita.

Empedocles, nc. 450, embodied the preceding prin-
ciples, and referred the origin of all things to six effecting

causes; two material, two oryoaio, and two demiuryio;
