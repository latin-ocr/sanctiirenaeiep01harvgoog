may formerly have been in existence. The general simi· Syriae

larity of extracts occurring in duplicate and triplicate ἓξὲξ,

copies, points to one single origina13 and the high antiquity —

of many of the codices in which they occur, is not con-

sistent with the suspicion that they may have been copied
· and recopied from isolated quotations. The extracts how-

ever are before the public, end we may be content to

leave the question to be settled by the discoveries of n

future generation. These Syriae fragments also indicate

a subdivision of the Books, that gives a general confirma-

tion to the Latin headings of the Arundel MS.. as shewn

in the present edition. The ¹Syriac subdivision very pro·

bably agreed with that indicated by Procopius, who quotes

the passage that refers to Adam’s tunica pellicea, III. xxxv.

(Tom. u. p. 128), as being found in the 59th section of the

third Book.

The names of a few other treatises by Irenaeus, and

some scattered fragments, have come down to us. His

Epistle to Florinus, also known by the title π. τῆς novap-

χίας, ἦ π. τοῦ adfirmaverit ποιητῆν κακῶν, has perished,

with the exception of the small portion preserved by

Eusebius, and found among the fragments in the second

volume. Florinus appears to have so insisted upon the ι’

unity of the Deity‚ as to have made him the author of evil, ΙΙ
s position never yet assumed by any heresy. The treatisep
caused Florinus to change his ground, and he took refuge ².
in the Valentinian hypothesim upon this, irenaeus, who ξ
appears to have hed a degree of regard for the offender ἰ
from ancient recollection, wrote the ’work π. τῆς ὀγδοάδος, ἱ

against the Valentinian Ogdoad. The solemn adjuration ¹
