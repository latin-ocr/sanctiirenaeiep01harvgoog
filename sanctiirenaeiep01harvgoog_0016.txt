quotations indeed will not justify the conjecture that
Hippolytus was the friend, at whose instance the work
was written, for the chronology of the two writers
makes the supposition wholly untenable; Hippolytus
must have been as young, when the work was written
e. Haereses, as Irenaeus was when he heard Polycarp.
If this work were written before an. 190, we know
that Hippolytus was in his ¹vigour nn. 250, when ²he
wrote against N oetus. He may have received instruc-
tion therefore from Irenaeus; buthe can scarcely have
suggested to him the need of such a work as that now
before us. These are questions however that belong
rather to the Life of Irenaeus' m a subsequent page
