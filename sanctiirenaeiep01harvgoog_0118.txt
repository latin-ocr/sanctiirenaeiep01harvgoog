BASlLlDES. xcv

¹Neander was of the same opinion, though not always so mnam,
positively. Baur also follows the same lead3 and there is Q
no reason why ²doubt should be thrown upon these mo·
dern deductions from ancient statements. Only it should
he borne in mind that all these heresies affected to revcrt
to opinions and theories that were anterior to all contem·
porary systema of philosophy; and, as we have seen. the
old Persian theory, like the Pythagorean, was Monodio,
but, like that system, exhibited a secondary development
of contending principles; Basilides therefore may ³very
consistently have asserted his belief in one Supremo Prin-
ciple, by whatever negative name he might call it, and
yet have symbolised with the general tecching of the
East as regards a coordinste antagonism of Good and
Eril. The latter, like the ε’νθῦμησις of the Valentinian
Pleroma, may have had its rise in this theory so soon as axv.
the evolution of divine attribute gave riae to the notion of
relation. ¹

The world when it was created was ἐξ οὑκ ὄντων, andin
this term we need scarcely recognise the Platonic distinction
of the nonantity of shifting variable matter, as compared
with the eternal invariable Being of the Deity; because
Plato extended the same definition to every product of
metten whereas the heretic nowhere describes the out·
ward world as osis ὤν. But the Deity created the universe aaa ra
from things nonexislent3 'cirros oris ὧν Oedi· ἑποῖησε κόσμον, Μ’
