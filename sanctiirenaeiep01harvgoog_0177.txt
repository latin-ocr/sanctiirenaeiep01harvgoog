Ha work members already in danger, but Irenaeua could scarcely have
Qlest it in its hour of greatest need, if the atorm had already
burst in its full fury, and its bishop been putto death.

In proportion as this visit to Rome shews, as a pro·
bable result, the elevation of henaeus to the vacant see,
the prosecution of his journey to the far distant East, as
stated by Feuardentius and Le Sueur, becomes in the
same degree improbable. Neither is it at all likely, that
he should have been the author of the account of the per·
secution sent from Lyons to the Churches of Asia, if he
had not been an eye-witness. Rather we may believe that
he returned home to be installed successor to Pothinus,
and milder times following, that he engaged actively in the
missionary work of converting pagan Gaul to Christ3 for he
was most truly 1φωστῆρ Γαλατῶν τῶν ἑσπερίων, and 'Be-
sanpon aud Valence are more expressly mentioned, as having
received the faith from Lyons during his incumbency. The
same period of respite from persecution also permitted
the Bishop to compose his great work against the heresias
that forced themselves upon his notice during his visit to
Rome, and that, penetrating into every province of tha
Western Empire, were gaining head rapidly upon the
banks of the Rhone. The work was written, aa Eusebius
has observed, during the Episcopate of Eleutherus, down
to whom the Roman succession is traced in the third
Book; but it was composed also after Theodotiou had
eompleted his version of the Scriptures of the Old Testa·
ment; referred by ³Epiphanius to the second year of Com·
modus, aa. 181. Therefore since Eleutherna was suc·
ceeded by Victor an. 189, this work must have been waic

ten some time during the seven years included between
an. 182 and 188.
