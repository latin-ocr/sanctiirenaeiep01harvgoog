riv 9⁶32, so this subordinate ἄρχων was ἀρρήτων ἇρρητό· ηιμ m

me Θεὸς, though his ὀγδοὰς was simply ἄρρητοι. The
hereal region having been reduced into order by him,
lthe ¹365 heavens, termed Aborras, created, another
(ων emanated from the subjective matter, and he
tained the subordinate neme of ἄρρητα. Hie sublunary
litat was the Hebdomad, and was ῥητός.

Both of these subordinate eutities were inferior in
gnity aud power to the lower scohood, still inherent iu
e world of matter. The Demiurge, for such was the
le and function of the lower principle that inhabited
eHebdomad, also eugendered a son of the quickened
res of matter, who, as in the preceding instance, ’was

greater excellence then the sire. But although the
emiurge reduced matter into order, it was according

the prcconceived plan of the 3Ιαοοοίιταὸἰο. Here again .
philosophical bearing for the myth of heresy may be
seerned3 the pantheist allowed that a soul of lise per-
ded the entire creation‚ but failed to see the ugency of ⁴
higher influencc‚ from whence proceeds that which we
nv call the ⁴courae os narrare. And so in every gnostio
eory the Demiurge worked out the plens of the Supremo,
rt it was in a spirit of dense ignoranoe.
