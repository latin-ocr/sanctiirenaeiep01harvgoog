Anaxa watery element, Anaxagoras resolved the combination, and
Μ’ assigned to the Deity an independent action in the dispo-
sition and governmcnt of all things. 1Νοῦς διακοσμῶν was

with him a moral as well as an intellectual principle, ’Ἀνοξιν

’γόρας δὲ (ῦς κινοῦν vd ἇγαθδν ἀρχήν· ὁεγᾶρ νοῦς κινεῖ, α’λλῦ

κινεῖ ἕνεκα τινος· und the source of τὸ καλοκάγαθόν, as
Aristotle again records; 3πολλαχοῦ μὲν ’γὰρ cd αἴτιοντοῦ

καλῶς καὶ ὀρθῶς τᾶν νοῦν λέγει, though he still made a
certain confusion between νοῦς and the vital principle φνχῆ,
affirming νῦν νοῦν εἶναι τᾶν αῦτὸν τῇ φνχῇ. For the ap-

theory of the East, and that his fellow citizens, confound-
ing philosophical with political heresy, accused him of
Medisiay, for we find that he ended his days in a voluntary
exile at Lampsacus. Pericles was his pupil, Thucydides
the historian received instruction from him, as well as
Democritus, Empedocles, Metrodorus of Lampsacus, AEsop
the tragedian, Socrates and Themistocles, while Euripides
lived on terms of intimacy with him.

But the clement of flvra was not omitted, exercising as
