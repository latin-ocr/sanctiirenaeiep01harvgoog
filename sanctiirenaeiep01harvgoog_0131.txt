ex VALENTINUS.

the early part of the second century, modified by the
emanational theory of the East; and so far as the religious
clement was embodied in it, dignified with certain leading
terma aud traditione of the Christian Religion. It is by

‚ no means asserted that this description is applicable to

the sect for any length of time from the founder. It
disappeared in all probability by attraction of its elementa
on the one hand, towards the more poetical system of
Valentinus, aud on the other, towards the neo-Platonie
opinions with which many principles were held in common.
¹Valentinus was an Egyptian, as Epiphanius states, of
the Phrebonitic nome; after receiving full Christian in·
struction, he lapsed from the saith, and amalgamating
together Catholic truths with various principles of the
Gnostic philosophy of his day, produced the system from
him called the Valentinian heresy. The use that this
heretic and his followers made of Scripture, plainly shows
that he had no superficial acquaintance with the Christian
doctrines. In Egypt he was still not only nominally of the
Chureh, but, if Epiphanius may be credited, a ²teacher. If
he had continued at Alexandria, possibly he might have
remaincd in comparative obscurity, and the five books of
Irenaeus, containing as they do information upon the Church
system and doctrine of the earliest period, that is of in-
ealeulable value, would never have been written. But he
transferred his teaching to Rome, about 140 aa, where
heresy as yet had never taken root; and he was soon
deposed from his order, if he had ever been admitted to

any sacred function, and expelled the Chureh³. He then
retired to Cyprus, the head quarters of his heresy; but re·
visited Rome on more than one occasion.
