rs; also that these two lines of philosophie thought Plutonia
averge and meet in Egyptian theories, such as have „12¹ssssss
eady been described ¹. Evidently the power and energy —
the mundane soul vvas indicated iu Egyptian myths as
llas in the Platonic theory. The entire system indeed
Egyptian mythology rested upon deified principles and
vrers of nature, of which Creuzer has given a closely
tailed account in his Symbolih aad Mytlwloyie. If there·
re it should be found in the Gnostic, and more specially

the Valentinian system, that the world was animated by
quasi Divino soul, the notion as originating in Egypt may
‚ve been the result of fusion of Egyptian and Platonic
eories. The connexion however between the Pleroma
’ Valentinus, with its correlative external Hebdomad‚
‚d anything similar in the Platonic system, is reserved
r future consideration.

One more particular may be mentioned as observable

the language of Plato. He continually speaks of the
eative aet as a μίμησις, having reference to that unity

design that formed oue of the characteristic attributes

his ideas. The analogies for instance of comparative
atomy vvould in his language be referred to the imitative
ineiple. Thus the Demiurge having caused divine
rences to exist, delegated to them the work of creating
ortal substance; and by an imitativa act, 'oi δὲ μιμού-
νοι, they embodied the divine soul in· its material ὄχημα.
