conclusive evidence against these fragments, taken as they
are from a work π. πίστεως, the very name whereby writ-
ings upon the elementary doctrines of the Christian saith
were generally designated3 1 am inclined therefore to

refer these fragments to some writing of minor import-
snce, that had chiefly a local application.

Irenaeus, on more than one occasion, declares his in-
tention to write a work ¹agsinst the Marcionite heresy,
which was developing strength, while the other forms of
Gnosticism were on the decline, in the last years of the
venerabis Father’s life. Other matters, however, and
none more probable than the duty of a more complete
evangelization of Gaul, interposed, and we may safely say
that the intention was never carried into effect3 for such a
work would have had an unusual interest for Eusebius,
and if published must have become known to him; but he
speaks of the promise as having led to no result: ἐπήγ-
γελται δὲ ὁαῦτδς ἐκ τῶν Μαρκίωνος συγγραμμάτων ἀντιλέξ-
ειν αὐτῷ ἐν ἰδίῳ σπουδάσματι. For the same reason the
notion entertained by many, that the account of the mar·
tyrs of Lyons and Vienne, transmitted to the Churches of
Asia, was a production of the pen of irenaeus, is hardly
rorthy of credit. It is impossible to imagine that Euse-
bius should have been ignorant of the authorship of so
celebrated a document, or that he should have omitted to
declara it, in transcribing the entire epistle in his History.
lleasons have already been assigned for supposing that
lrenaeus was at Rome during the heat of this persecution,
aad the epistle was evidently written by an eyewitness.
The same consideration may be urged against Massuet's
surmise, that the 'fragment preserved by OEcumenius from
