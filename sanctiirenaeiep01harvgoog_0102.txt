other lew, agreed in many points with the Ebionite. He
taught the mere human origin of J eeus; and hie misbeliel
upon thie point accounts for his repetition of the Ebionite
assentiam that a like degree of sanctity was within reaeh

of any other man, since all human souls are from the
same source, and share the same nature. But hie impiety ano.
in this respect carried him to a more ’fearful pitch of
blasphemy than hie predecessore. Irenaeus states that he
treated with equal reverence the likenese of Christ, and

ol the heathen philosophere, Pythagoras, Plato, and
Aristotle; if we take into account that hie successor Pro-
dicus professed to have the Apocalypsis of ³Zor0aster as

his text-hook, we may collect that synereticism in the
widest sense was the true Carpocratian principle. Even
the heathcn mysteriee perhaps met with· no disfavour from
him. Hc in fact appears to have given a wider expansion

to Gnosticiem, and where hie predecessore, in ascribing
the creation of the world to certain creative angelic
powers, imagined to themselves an efflux from the Good
Principle, Carpocrates carried the Oriental principle out

to ite fullest extent; and, with a rooted dielike to hie
former religion, affirmed that these creator angele, by
reason of the remoteness of their origin from the source nm
of all, were in fact ⁴evil in their nature; and that the
great object of Christ’s mission to the human racc was,

that he might redeem mankind ‚from the power of these

rooponowl ἄγγελοι.

Similarly, hie mode of describing the first Principle
agreed with that of most other Gnostic teachcrs, and the
Source of all, that in the Simonian theory was ἀόρατος,
