So there can be no doubt but that Gnosticism in iu
essencc, so far as it affected a recognition of the Chris
tian history, dated from Simon Magus3 and yet the name
of Gnostic was only first adopted, ss a body, hythe Ophites
or Naasscnes, of whom Hippolytus has said, μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα

ἐπεκάλεσαν ιάντοῦι Γ νωστικοῦς· φάσκοντες μόνοι ταὶ βάθη

γινώσκειν, ἐξ ὦν ἀπομερισθέντα πολλοὶ πολυσχιδῆ τὴν αἵρεσιν

ἕποιήσαν μίαν, διαφόροις δόγμασι ‘rai edrai διηγοῦμενοι. Both
philosophy and theosophical teaching, as exhibited at
Alexandria, laid claim to an esotcric assimilation with the
Source of spiritual Light and Knowledge. Heathen Mys·
ticism in the same way claimed a knowledge of the deep
Truths that were scaled up in its arcana, and the system
that affected to incorporate the more salient points of
each, could hardly have received a more convenient term
than ysaiae, to symbolisc the eclecticism to which it owed
ite origin.

The term γνῶσις therefore embodies a highly complex
idea, when we consider the various elementa of which it
was the outward expressi0n; and in proportion as any one
of these elements has been clearly perceived, writers upon
the Gnostic theorice of the primitive ages of the Church,
have referred them generically to this or that particular
class of opinion. Mosheim has treated them as almost
entirely of Oriental growth3 Neander divides them into
the two families of Jewish, and anti-Jewish Gnosticism,
