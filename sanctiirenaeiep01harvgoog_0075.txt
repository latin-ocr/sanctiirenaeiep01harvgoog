——slone by pure reason. They were the real and etemal
substance of every principle of proportion and harmony,
and of all that is true and just and beautiful; and in this
way, however true it may he that the fundamental notion
of his ideas was derived by Plato from the definitione of
his master Socrates, or more remotcly from the· Pytha-
orean harmony of numbers, or even from sources of
a yet higher antiquity3 still in their ultimate form they
were a creation of the wonderful intelligence of Plato;
and the nearer approximetion that he made in other
respects to inspired Truth, only made it more certain
that his would be the system singlcd out by heresy as
its exemplar. (

In its cruder form then the doctrine of divine ἰδέαι
may evidently have had a niche in the intellectual system
of more primitive times. The notion is in fact inse·
parable from belief in the existence of sn eternel and
forecasting Divine Intelleet. Iambhehus, as a Neo·
Pletonist, would hardly have expressed himself in such
a way, as to imply that the founder of his philosophy
followed the Egyptian teaching with respect to the
ideology of things create, if hc had not felt very certain
of his ground. He accounts for the symbolical character

of the Egyptian religione system, by saying, that it was
intended to symbolise the Divine ideas veiled beneath
forms of matter1. The goddess Isis herself was the per·
sonification of the same notion²; and if wc had the means
of following the theory back to its more remote source, wc

should in all probability trace it to the great emporium of
intellectual as well as of commercial antiquity, on the
banks of the Euphrates; it was alive ember perhaps from
altars of s yet more remote period.
