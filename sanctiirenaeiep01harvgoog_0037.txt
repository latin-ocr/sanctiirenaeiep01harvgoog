x PERSIA.

Eury The ancient religion of Persia appears to have been
Fffippfpf far more closely allied with the Pantheism of the Brabmin,
’““““““ than with the Polytheism of the Greek; and it was from

this source possibly that Thales and his successore in the
Ionio school of physieal philosophy borrowed their first
principles. They believed that a Divine life existed in
the elementary forms of matter. So the Persian paid Di-

vine honours to the primary στοιχεῖα, as Hnnonoros says,

θύουσι δι’ ἡλίῳ renai σελήνῃ noi γῇ xci eropi xci ridere roi

ἀνέμοισι. The natural creation‚ an object of deep and super-

stitious veneration in primitive times, may have given rise

to idolatry when Hrnonorus wrote, but the proof is not

made out, that the Persians knew anything of the Zabian

practices of the ¹inferior Shemitic tribes, before their yoke

was imposed upon those tribes. As compared with the

later religious belief of heathenism‚ the old Persian religion

was venerable for its greater purity, though it was only

a comparative purity. eratever degree of truth it retained

was derived traditionelly from the very cradle of the humen

race; it was no mere produci of human intellect. as Beru-

u sonan seems to have imagined, ‘¹ Cette oncimne religion . ..

· ι’ de la muniere qa’ort noua la dimit, eat la plns pure qne lo

raison lvumoine ait jamnis inoptata'' But it was debased

1 . at length by the reaotion of Greek impurities as, Hnao-
norns has candidly contessed.

The ancient Persian religion was modified in the reign

’ of Cyrus by Zoroaster, who 2restored and fixed old forms
