great work of creatiou, which, like the ideas of Plato, may

have had a ruder connterpart in the arcano of Egyptian

or Babylonian theosophy. Adam Cadmon, the Philonia

Logos, was -the Cahhalistic impersonation of this ideal
system, who for this reason was termed μακρόκοσμος, or
Γξῑξξᾞζξ, μακροπρόσωποςῑ. Of each of these systema it
may be observed, and the idea was strictly preserved as a

Gnostic axiom, that the various emanatione vvere perfect

as in the planetary system, gravity and density increase
according to the squares of distance from the Suu, so in
the emanative theory, each successive evolution was more
imperfect and less spiritual than the preceding, until the
