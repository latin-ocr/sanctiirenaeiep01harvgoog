,ΪἭ to it. Plato affirmed something of the same kind, when
hc said that ²“ to discover the Creator of the universe is a
work of difficulty, but to bring him within the cognizance
of all, impossible.” In the Theoetetas, indeed, the subject
of which is a discussion of the question, “what is know·
ledge ?’' three principal theorica are advanced and refuted,
without arriving at any positive solution to the question3
yet the overthrow of these theorics only proves the carn-
estness with which each of the three tenebere, Heraclitus
Protagoras, and Theaetetus had claimed for their respec-
tive systems an exclusive origin srom the fountain-head of
knowledge. ³Elsewherc, a true γνῶσις is identified with
an intellectuat, that is at the same time inseparablc from a
moral perception of the Divine Principle. In Persia,
‘Zoroaster asserted a still more lofty principle, in engaging
his followers to an intellectual abstraction from the world
of matter. The very name γνώστικος is a translation rather
of the ⁵0riental synonyme for φιλόσοφος, than a term of
indigenous growth, and marked the votary of esoteric
knowledgc3 while the union of the spiritual principle in
man with the Divine Substance, was the γνῶσις with which
it professed to deal, and represented that contemplative
abstraction of the faculties of the soul, and ecstatic union
with thc Divine Principlc, that has always been the great
object of aspiration to tho Eastcrn dcvotee; and that
formed so marked a feature in the ⁶neo-Platonic School
of Alexandria.
