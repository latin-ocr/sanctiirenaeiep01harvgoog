Consecrat- It is useless to investigate, with ¹Massuet, the proba-
⁶dB¹⁸h⁰p. bilities of his ordination3 whether he received his divine
commission at the hands of Pothinus, crof some other
bishop. Neither is it a very material consideration, in a
controversial point of view, whether or not he was eonse-
crated as successor to Pothinus hythe Bishop of Rome;
forthere was no other Gallican see at this period than
that of Lyons, as the ²Benedictine establishes3 it was by
necessity therefore, and not in considerationes the potior
principalitas, that the chureh of Lyons, in such a case,
would apply to Rome for the consecration of a successor
to its martyred bishop. Whether he was sent to Rome
ior the express purpose of consecration‚ is, to say the least,
doubtful. Certainly he was charged with a letter to
Rome by certain leading members of the Chureh oi
Lyons, who awaited in prison their crown of mnrtyrdom3
but the substance of the letter sent was ἐἰρήνης incra: if
it had been intended as the expression of a wish that the
bearer should be consecrated bishop, the wish would have
been conveyed in less enigmatical terms, than these upon
which Massuet builds his theory; xci παρακαλοῦμεν ἔχειν
