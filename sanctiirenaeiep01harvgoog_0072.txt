his teaching‚ it can hardly admit ol' a doubt, but that he Pythago
learned from the same source to refer the origin of all to ffiph}
the antagonising action ol' φιλία and ννῐκονῑ. And these mm,
peculiarities of the Pythagorean system were reflectedffl'*
alterwards in every successive phase ol' Gnosticism.

With the moral bearings of this system we are only so
tar concerned as to remark, that Pythagoras according to
Plutarch, maintained tbe Oriental account of the origin of
evil; evil having been necessarily inherent in the dyad
representative of the multitudinous ²universe; buthe held
simrdtaneously, as we have seen, the dualistic theory of
the East, and these assertione at least may shew that the
Gnostic heresiarche need not have derived their dualism
immediately from Eastern sources; it had already pos-
session of men's minds in tbe West. The psychology
of Pythagoras harmonised with his pantheistic teachiug.
For here, as the world of nature was the material counter·
part of the abstract laws of numbers, μίμησις 1Ιῶν ἀριθμῶν,
so the soul was an efflux from the Monadic source of all.
Like its divine exemplar, it had its own independent
power of action and progression, it was ᾰριθμδν ievrdvffirylffi

with the notion that the supreme Monad was an objective
harmony, a definite Law of that which is Good and True,
rather than subjective Goodness and Trutb itself; but it

was wholly inconsistent with a belief in the independent
