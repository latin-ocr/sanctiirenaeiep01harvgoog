thought represented by these two great names that we
are at present chiefiy concerncd3 for they were clearly
represented in the Valentinian theory.

of the first of these systema, the Pythagorean philo

the master having left ¹nothing on record, and his im-
mediate ²disciples nothing3 while a glare of false light
hasbeen thrown upon this page of the history of philo·
sophy by many spurious productione. This however we
may safely assert; that Pythagoras learned in ³Egypt to
theorise upon the practical system of geometry that had
subsisted in that country from ancient days. His investi·
gations were rewarded by a discovery of the harmonious
laws of this sciense, aud of the orderly powers and pro·

He first learned to appreciate regularity of aetion in the
exact sciemus, whose threshold he penetrated, and to
venerate it as belonging to a more ‘divine system of things
than earth otherwise possessed. The operatione of laws,
that had existed indeed from the beginning, but had

and why should uot the universe be full of such laws? or
rather, why should not the universe itself he one eternal
