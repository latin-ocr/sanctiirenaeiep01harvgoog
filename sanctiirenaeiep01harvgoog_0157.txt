Demiurge.

cxxxvi vnnnwrnaus.

Achamoth therefore having now received her forma-
tion rard γνῶσιν, originated those spiritual powers of
inferior grade, that were no longer considered too subtle
for intermixture with the gross essencc of matter. These
were, Demiurpc, ¹fiery as the first matter of Plato, formed
after the image of Monopeaec or Nnc by the co-opera-
tion of Sotcrr and the various angelic and archangelic

counterparts of the AEons; these also peoplcd the psychic
habitatos Demiurge, constituting the seven astronomica!

becrens, or ’Hebdomon or Ἀνάπαυσις, and in which the
scula of the faithful and elect are reserved as in a place

of rest; ³⁷15) Ἀβρααμ καὶ τοῖς λοιποῖς δικαίοις τοῖς ἐν τῇ

α’ναπαῦσει οὖσιν ἑν τοῖς δεξιοῖς. Both the psycbic or dectral,
and the hylic or cin-iatrat principle were emhcdied inform
by Demiurge3 the first being analogous to the formation
of the mundane soul in the Timaeus, while the consolida·
tion of the second represented the Platonic sifting of oppo-
site demente, κοῦφων καὶ βαρεῶν, ἀνωφερῶν rui καταφερῶν.
There is also a close ratio to be observed between this
portion of the Valentinian and of the Platonie theorice,
and Achamoth was to her hypostatised πάθη, as the ⁴crea·
tor deities of Plato were to thc first matter3 also, Acha-
moth with these various πάθη, was to cyanus, aethe
Platonic creators with the first matter, were to the Su-
preme. So, again, a definite analogy may be traced
between tte three relations of the Divine Principle in the
later Platonic idea, and the triple progression of Valenti-

elder it ruled the younger or bodily Athone, the impcmonation of the Di·
