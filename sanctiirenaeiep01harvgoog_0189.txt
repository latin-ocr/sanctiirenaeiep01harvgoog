irenaeus, with reference to the answer of ¹Blandina to the
heathen persecutor, was from this same epistle. It was

much more probably taken from the treatise πρὸς Ἕλληνας,
setting forth the cruelties that the Gallicas Church had
suffered in times of persecution3 the moral argument for
the truth of the Christian religion afforded hythe con·
stancy of its martyrs3 the true idea also to be attached to
Sacramental Comrnunion, which Justin Martyr did not
shrink from revealing in a similar way to the heathen.
The term Ἕλληνες would bear the wider meaning of hea-
then, both in the title of the Irenaean treatise, and in the
fragment now under consideration. Of the interpretation
of the Apocalypse mentioned by S. J erome, it is sufficient
to say, that he refers in all probability tc the statements
of the fifth book c. Hoer. upon this portion of Scripture.
Photius moreover gives the title of a work Dc Universa,
or de Substantia Mundi, ascribed by some to our author.
The fragment numbered XXXII. may with some proba·
bility be referred to this work.

A certain degree of mystery attaches to the three
fragments edited from the Turin collection by Pfaff; not
at all however in consequence of any doubt that can affect
the editor's account of how, when, and where he obtained
them; but by reason of the entire disappearance of the
Codices from whence they were taken. The fragments in
question were published at the Hagne an. 1715; in 1749
the ²catalogue of the Turin collection was printed, and its
editors, after diligent search through various Caras, could
find no trace of them. Withont charging Pfaff with dis·
honesty of any kind, they ask the very natural question
why he gave no reference to the class-mark of the Codex,
