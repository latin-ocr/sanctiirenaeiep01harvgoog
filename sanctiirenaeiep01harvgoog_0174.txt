was probably communicated soon after Victor's accession orbius.
to the pontificate sn. 188. If therefore at this date Ire-—
noens had attained his sixtieth year, about 128 sn. would

be indicated for his birth. But in the body of his work

α Ηασ. he speaks of haring heard Polycarp‚ already far
advanced in years, ἐν τῇ πρώτη ἡμῶν ἡλικίᾳ, and the term
hasbeen identified more closely than the phrase can justify‚

with that used in the Epistle to Florinus, παῖς ών ἔτι. For

the author himself explains the expression as meaning

ισσσῖη lise, extending to about the thirtieth year; at least

it is impossible to obtain any more satisfactory meaning ,
than this from the translator's words, quia autem triginta
annorum αισα prima indoles est juvenis, (ὅτι δὲ τῶν τριώ-

κοντα ἐτῶν ἡ ἡλικία πρώτη τῆς διαθέσεώς ἐστι νέας). It is

the ¹cardinal point that separatas the youthful from the
formed character. It is not necessary indeed to suppose,
that Irenaaus spent the whole of this πρώτη ἡλικία at Smyrna
under ita venerable Bishop. The cause of the Gospel in
all probability drew him into Gaul, soon after the age had
been attained for ordination; and Polycarp‚ who was not less
than ³eightysix years of age when he suffered martyrdom‚
an. 167, may have survived the departure cf Irenssns from
Smyrna fortan or fifteen years, and yet bave been more
than threeacorc years aad ten, when our author last heard
the sound of his voice. The expression therefore, ἐν τῇ
πρώτη ἡμῶν ἡλικίᾳ, in no way militates against the suppo·
sition now advanced, that the birth of Irenaeus may be re-
ferred to an earlier period by at least ten years, than has
usually been decmed possible, and that au. 130 is no very
unlikely date for this event.
