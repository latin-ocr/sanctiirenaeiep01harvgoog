opponents Ophiten· much as the Barteltotae were termed
ιΒορβοριίινοι from βόρβορος, much as also the Ophite term
'Prnnr‘coa was interpreted from an unnecessarily excep·

formerly considered as being suggestive of the idea of

ὄφις, are greatly absurd. Thus, according to Irenaeus, these
heretics imagined a Serpentisormia Nam also that Sophia r· 2³2·

the tortuous AEon. Irenaeus however was writing nearly

three quarters of a century after-the sect had passed into

other forms; and Hippolytus, perhaps a more critical
reviewer of early opinions, indicates that their name was
caused by their philosophy, which referred the origin of

an object of veneration in the Mithratic code. For this ¹ ¹ ⁸
reason Hippolytus termed the heresy ὕδρα, the Hydra or
‘water serpent. Hence their ⁶hymn in praise of a principle

that Pindar had similarly celebrated before. He indicates

that some similarity was imagined between the convolu-

tions of the brain, and the contortions of the serpent. Of ᾖ 132 ¹132
