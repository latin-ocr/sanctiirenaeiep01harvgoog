substance, the antecedent representative of grosser mattam analogica
the counterpart of which we easily identify in this transcen-
dental product of Achamoth’s passion. Τὸ ἐν ᾧ ’γίγνεται is
sufficiently descriptive of the lower Ogdoas the region of
Achamoth3 it was the cradle of creation, from whence the
earliest germ of the material dated its rise. Again, 1τόπος,
the habitat of Demiurge, was in the Platouic scheme the
recipient of the eternal conception of things material in
the Divine Intelligence, and it had its counterpart in the
Pythagorean sd κενὸν, thc brenthing ground, as it' were, of
the animated world3 'oi Πυθαγόρου ε’κτόν εἶναι τοῦ κόσμον
reads, sis d ἇναπνεῖ ὁ κόσμος sol ἐξ οὖ. Achamoth then
was placed for the present εἰς τον ὑπερονράνιου τόπον 'rodr- psa
εστιν ἓν τῇ μεσότητι, where the term μεσότης slso was
suggested by Plato’s μεσότητες or harmonio means, which ινξερτα
he iuterposes in the generation of ψυχή. And further the
constitution of Demiurge himself, intellectual but not
spiritual, and evolred by Achamoth at the sometime with

the protideal substance of matter, is in close harmony

with the formation of the mundane soul in Pinto; the
Creator having taken a portion of indivisible substancc,oiel naa
sord ταῦτᾶ, eternally the same, and of that which is divisi·

hle, formed of them a third mean substance τρίτου ἐξ
ἀμφοῖν ἐν με’σῳ ξυνεκερᾶσατο ουσίαν εἶδος, consisting in part

of each, τῆς τε ταὺτοῦ φύσεως ai περὶ καὶ τῆς θατέρου, and
placed the substance, thus formed, midway between the
divisible and the indivisible, rard ταῦτα ξυνέστησεν ἐν μέσῳ

τοῦτο ἆμερους αὐτῶν καὶ τοῦ rard roi σώματα μεριστοῦ.

Still this composite substance was only ideal, τρία λαβών

terma we traca the original of the Valentinian evolution
of Achamoth, and the animal principle Demiurge, as also
