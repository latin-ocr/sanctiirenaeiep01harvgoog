copied Valentinian Christ to the Pleroma after a transient efful-
QQ genes upon Achamoth3 while the essential aroma as it
were of Sonhood, that, as Basilides said, still attached to
the Spirit, was no less evidently represented in the vitavi
ἀφθαρσίας that adhered to Achamoth as the gift of Christ
and of the Holy Spirit. It may'be observed in passing,
that the modicum of Christian instruction that Valentinus
had received is manifested in his doctrine of the Spirit.
In the Basilidian scheme the Spirit was said clearly not to
-x x.·· be consubstantial with the Sonbood; though the odour of
Sonhood passed not wholly over from it; bnt Valentinus
in correction oi this gross misappreeiation of Christian doe·
trine, declared that Christ and the Holy Spirit are concub
stantial with each other; while the relation in which they
stood to the AEons of the Pleroma, the various modes of
the Divine subsistenee, was to reduce all to one principle
of unity, so that under the intluence of one heavenly

. bond, all were equally Divine Mind, all were Logos, and
Truth, and Life, δια, &c.; in other words, Christ and
the Holy spirit, as existing in the perfect consubstantia-
tion of the ¹Pleroma, were themselves consubstantial with
the Divine Entities of which it consisted. Further, in the
Basilidian scheme, the unformed mass of ²matter‚ called
there, ἀμορφία and πανσπερμία, was first evolved, and from
this unformcid mass the psychic Opdood, or μέγας ἄρχων,
had his being. In a similar manner the Passion of Acha-
moth gave rise in the first instance to ρνὶαιανμ matter, τοῦ

. μὲν ἐκ τοῦ πάθους, ὀ ἦν ὕλη, but subsequently to the psychic
principle, from whence Demiurge emanated, the Ruler oi
all that was consubstantial with his own psychic nature,
and organiser of the material, τῶν ἐκ τοῦ πάθους καί τῆς
