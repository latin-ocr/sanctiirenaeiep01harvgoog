Develop Majesty of the Supreme Being‚ was effected without the
mppps Pleroma, aud Demiurge was the unconscious agent, per·
—‘ forming his functions in entire ignorance of the Divine
ιὶδοίιι, or archetypal forms, as well as of the Supreme
Bythos. The notion that he imagined himself to be the
Supreme and only God, bears perhaps upon the belief of
physical philosophers, that the world itselt' was the Deity.
It was the very general conclusion arrived at by the ψιχικὸο,

or natural man.

Evil, as in the Persian theory of Zoroaster, was no
true co·ordinate of the Suprema Good; but it was mixed
up with its primary emanation‚ so soon as discretive attri-
bute brought in the idea of relation. Thus the first germ

of evil shewed itself with Nus; and the aboriginal Enthy-
meme was to Monogenes, as Ahriman was to Ormuzd. At

a later point the principle of moral evil, τοὶ πνευματικὰ τῆς
πονηρίας, productive also of physical evil, emanated from

the pries of Achamoth. Hence Satauic influence was
closely mixed in with the mundane principle; and yrias
. rather than any other affection marked the hypostatic
character of this Cosmocrator and his angela, as being
the negation of ²the Holy Spirit, which we are charged
not to yrieve. The duelling of Cosmocrator was the
world; his proper clement was air, as the patulam of
ytre,· and the world contained within itself the latent ele-
ment, that in the end should burst forth and ⁸annihilate
matter. The distractior of Achamoth was descriptive of
the blind but continuous κίνησις, with which matter was
