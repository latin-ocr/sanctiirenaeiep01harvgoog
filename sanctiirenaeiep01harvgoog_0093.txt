ἕσσας-στανσπησόμςνος. In the Mithratie worship especiul
veneration was paid to the Sun, Moon, aud material ele-
ments; in the same way ³Simon paired off the above six
emanatione, as the heavenly counterparts of material cor·
relative objects of sense; and he called νοῦς and ἐπίνοια,
οῦρανός καὶ γῆ, while ὄνομα καὶ φωνή represented the Sun
and Moon, and the last two, Air and Water. The self-same
objects arc instanced by Herodotus in his account of the
old Persian religion. In the Zoroastrian system again,
the human prototypal substance was ‘evolved prior to the
creation of its material organism; ⁵the Cabbala borrowed
the same notion; 6ΡΙήΙο adopted it; and Simon Magus,
as we might imagine, exhibited a similar feature in his

system ⁷irrhace' φησιν ο’ Θεός πάν ἄνθρωπον, χοῦν dard τῆς·

καὶ καθ ὁμοίωσιν. In other respects, he converted the
Hexaemeron into an 'allegory in which the notione of
Zoroaster, Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, are strangcly
intermixed. Hippolytus has preserved a few sentences
from the Ἀποφάσοις, or Expositioas of the Mage, that are oi
singular valae, as enabling us to dciine the precise features
of Gnosticism‚ when it first affected the History of Chris
tianity. The passage runs as followst
