Basilides then was a teacher of philosophy rather

was to be destroyed3 and man could plead no
ption from the universal law. On the other hand,
ay truce in Basilides the hardy sels-dependent spirit
rilosophy, which, denying every special interferenee of
livine principle, asserted the tendency of all rational

r; only his rational νἰότης was elect by nature, and its
rtages were limited to one particular class, as was the
in the theories of Saturninus and os Valentinus next
a considered. It was in the same spirit of saith in
gth growing up from below, and of man's perfect
y, that the son of Demiurge, and os the superior
